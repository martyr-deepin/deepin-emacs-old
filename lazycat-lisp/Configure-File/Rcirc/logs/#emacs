2008-10-31 20:08 kuwabara         what is the equivalent of vim's "n" (next occurence of last search) ? The best sequence I could find is: C-s (trigger search mode) M-p M-p (navigate to find last search string) C-s (find next). Is there a shorter way ?

2008-10-31 20:14 kuwabara         And while I am at it, does anyone know the equivalent of Vim's C-o/C-i (migrating after 15 years of intense usage is hard, I need your help...) ? Successive C-o/C-i's move backward/forward to the various places I was before. A bit like undo, but just for the cursor, without changing anything.
2008-10-31 20:14 kzar             Say if I have a file containing lots of lines something like '"1","blah","example=test","name=herbert"' and I want to sort the fields at the end for each line alphabetically. So in that example it would stay the same but if name and example where swapped it would sort those for me. How do you think I could do that?

2008-10-31 21:43 offby1           When you exit the incremental search, it adds the original value of point to the mark ring, without activating the mark; you can thus use `C-u C-<SPC>' to return to where you were before beginning the search. *Note Mark Ring::.  It only does this if the mark was not already active.
2008-10-31 21:44 offby1           that's not quite it either.

2008-11-03 17:08 hermione         man 7 regex?
2008-11-03 17:08 toddoon          No manual entry for regexp in section 7
2008-11-03 17:08 hermione         Pay attention
2008-11-03 17:09 bpalmer          toddoon: negating a regular expression is not nearly so trivial. It's better to do it in logic.
2008-11-03 17:10 toddoon          bpalmer: so what your solution?
2008-11-03 17:10 skorpan          regexen are not useful for what you want to do toddoon
2008-11-03 17:10 hermione         That depends on what you mean by "negation" :-)
2008-11-03 17:10 snogglethorpe    tsp: i don't quite undersatnd your probelm WRT matching binary characters
2008-11-03 17:10 skorpan          they are good at saying what *may* be there, but not at saying what may *not*
2008-11-03 17:10 toddoon          hermione: i mean that i want to match all expression which doesnt contains INSERT
2008-11-03 17:11 Odin-            /join 
2008-11-03 17:11 hermione         toddoon: to do that, you need to match ([^I]|I[^N]|IN[^S]|...|INSER[^T])
2008-11-03 17:12 toddoon          hermione: oh damm...
2008-11-03 17:12 bpalmer          (actually, it's a little more complicated, because you also need to deal with anchoring and possibilities)
2008-11-03 17:13 bpalmer          for example, "123456INSERT" would match such a regular expression, since there are 6 characters in a row that are not "INSERT"
2008-11-03 17:13 bpalmer          so, (not (string-match "INSERT" mystring))
2008-11-03 17:14 toddoon          it is too complicated with regexp
2008-11-03 17:14 toddoon          bpalmer: ok i think it is better
2008-11-03 17:14 bpalmer          generator expressions, otoh ... 
2008-11-03 17:15 toddoon          what is string-match?
2008-11-03 17:15 skorpan          C-h f string-match RET
2008-11-03 17:16 toddoon          skorpan: ok thx but how can i use, i cant type it in mini-buffer
2008-11-03 17:16 tsp              snogglethorpe: did you read my posts to g.e.h and emacs-devel?
2008-11-03 17:16 skorpan          that's because it's not a command, only a function!
2008-11-03 17:16 tsp              if not I can explain here
2008-11-03 17:16 snogglethorpe    it seems like things work properly with `looking-at' but not with `re-search-forward'
2008-11-03 17:17 snogglethorpe    or if it's a unibyte buffer, things work ok
2008-11-03 17:17 tsp              unibyte not quite
2008-11-03 17:17 tsp              (insert (decode-coding-string "line 1\nline 2\377\371" 'raw-text-unix)))
2008-11-03 17:17 snogglethorpe    then I can search for the \377\371 fine

2008-11-03 17:17 snogglethorpe    works

2008-11-03 17:18 toddoon          how can i invoke these functions?
2008-11-03 17:18 snogglethorpe    either with surrounding \( ... \) or without
2008-11-03 17:18 toddoon          and where?
2008-11-03 17:18 tsp              strange
2008-11-03 17:18 sangu            /join 
2008-11-03 17:18 snogglethorpe    however if the buffer's _multibyte_ it doesn't work
2008-11-03 17:18 tsp              most buffers are multibyte
2008-11-03 17:18 snogglethorpe    I think that maybe because it's trying to auto-conver the search string?
2008-11-03 17:19 tsp              I was trying every permutation of the nibyte conversion functions I could think of
2008-11-03 17:19 snogglethorpe    tsp: yeah but if you've got a buffer with wacky characters in it, you need to think carefully about what you're doing
2008-11-03 17:21 tsp              I even tried the unicode value of \377 in that encoding, \x3fffff
2008-11-03 17:21 tsp              it works, until I put \\( and \\) in the string
2008-11-03 17:22 tsp              I think it might have something to do with the part of the manual I quoted in my last post to g.e.h

2008-11-03 18:03 KyleLee          such as cc-mode, CEDET, cscope/xref/global, and ? What's the best practice ? thanks.

2008-11-03 18:05 hermione         Best practice is, obviously, to avoid C++ because it's bloated, featureless, slow junk.

2008-11-11 10:08 Dawgmatix        hello - i have an emacs question - i am trying to do opengl development using emacs. the opengl committee has released manpages for opengl in a docbook format. what is the best way to use this from emacs ?
2008-11-11 10:09 Dawgmatix        i want to be able to highlight a function name, and run an elisp function to pull up the opengl man page for that function 
2008-11-11 10:09 bob2             convert to man files
2008-11-11 10:10 bob2             then use M-x man
2008-11-11 10:10 Dawgmatix        i know that the lisp development environment (slime) in emacs does this for lisp symbols (you can click a symbol) and ask emacs to show you the corresponding hyperspec entry 
2008-11-11 10:10 Dawgmatix        isnt info better integrated with emacs ?

2008-11-11 16:57 twb              19:46 <snogglethorpe> i guess it's because the tty eats it for flow control
2008-11-11 16:57 twb              Oh, of course I have flow control disabled.
2008-11-11 16:58 twb              So now I'm trying to implement just-one-space for M-SPC

2008-11-11 22:23 RadioApeShot     Is there some systematic way of understanding why <BACKSPACE> sometimes does not delete back across endlines and sometimes it does?  I have looked at the DEL does not DELETE page in the emacs manual and while that does enable backspace, it still does not delete across line endings.

2008-11-11 22:34 delYsid          Why do you use a macro to do stuff like echo in minibuffer?

2008-11-12 08:34 bpalmer          so here's a random question for people: how do other people, inside a *shell* or *eshell* or the like, support pagers as small finite generators?
2008-11-12 08:34 technomancy      I don't really see the point of a pager in eshell since it's so easy to scroll back w/o one
2008-11-12 08:35 sybarite1        derekv: well.... white isnt too cool for an editor, i think, and courier isnt the sexiest font. so i think you've done good
2008-11-12 08:35 bpalmer          technomancy: yeah, for those purposes a pager is not necessary; but most of the time what I use less for is to browse (e.g., foo | less  where foo could potentially generate thousands of lines; but I am just wanting to look at its output until one particular line, or see some representative results)
2008-11-12 08:36 technomancy      bpalmer: yeah; I usually use grep or head for that
2008-11-12 08:36 technomancy      or pipe it to a buffer
2008-11-12 08:36 bpalmer          in theory, head , or perl -lane 'print until /.../';, but it's hard to train my fingers to type that.
2008-11-12 08:37 technomancy      right; sure
2008-11-12 08:38 bpalmer          I haven't exactly figured what i want; but I can't help but think xemacs should be able to be a pager.

2008-11-12 09:05 quotemstr        Ok...
2008-11-12 09:05 twb              Firefox and Thunderbird use /dev/random when they start.
2008-11-12 09:05 quotemstr        Wonderfull
2008-11-12 09:05 quotemstr        What reads that file?
2008-11-12 09:05 twb              And whenever they access an https thing
2008-11-12 09:06 twb              Now the funny part:
2008-11-12 09:06 quotemstr        Actually, I think that's not so bad: at least Firefox is interactive.
2008-11-12 09:06 quotemstr        If it's blocking on /dev/random, you can just wiggle the mouse for a bit.
2008-11-12 09:06 twb              When you have just booted a thinnish client, there is no entropy in /dev/random
2008-11-12 09:06 twb              So the system Just Sits There
2008-11-12 09:06 twb              Which you can "fix" by mashing the keyboard...
2008-11-12 09:07 twb              And because these systems have no persistent disks, this problem happens after EVERY BOOT
2008-11-12 09:07 quotemstr        Seems like it would be simple to just patch Firefox in that case.
2008-11-12 09:07 quotemstr        Or ln -sf urandom random
2008-11-12 09:09 twb              "simple", "patch", and "firefox" don't belong in the same sentence unless you have a negative somewhere.
2008-11-12 09:10 twb              And yeah, I think we ended up doing the symlink bullshit -- although actually you can't just use a symlink -- you have to write a udev rule!
2008-11-12 09:10 twb              Computers suck
2008-11-12 09:11 quotemstr        Wonderful.
2008-11-12 09:11 quotemstr        (In a situation like that, I'd have been tempted to screw udev alltogether and use a static /dev.)
2008-11-12 09:12 twb              I'm sure there was some other reason that was unpleasant
2008-11-12 09:12 fledermaus       or build the kernel to include more sources of entropy? it's an option iirc.

2008-11-17 13:22 e1f              the camera seems to have autofocused at infinity-1
2008-11-17 13:22 e1f              the shots were slightly blurrt but it does look like the moon
2008-11-17 13:23 snogglethorpe    my big quandary was how to get a precise focus when the subject was far off center (when it's near the center, the split-image and lenticular parts of the focus screen make it easy)
2008-11-17 13:23 e1f              i have 10x magnifier when in livevide mode so i can resolve details better and adjust the focus manually
2008-11-17 13:23 e1f              but it's difficult when holding the camera manually
2008-11-17 13:24 e1f              you focus on the object and then recompose the shot
2008-11-17 13:24 jordanb          snogglethorpe; I'd recommend manuvering the camera such that the subject is in the split image thing, adjusting the zoom, then manuvering the camera into the position where the framing is how you want it.
2008-11-17 13:24 snogglethorpe    e1f: you're kidding, right?
2008-11-17 13:25 e1f              eh?
2008-11-17 13:25 e1f              assuming you have a wide enough dof, it works
2008-11-17 13:25 jordanb          I bet e1f has a cell phone on his belt.
2008-11-17 13:25 snogglethorpe    jordanb: yeah, but that doesn't actually work correctly, because the image plane is flat, whereas simply rotating the camera would only work correclty if it where a hemisphere
2008-11-17 13:26 jordanb          The focus isn't different on the edges than in the middle, for a given range.
2008-11-17 13:26 jordanb          Not significantly so.

2008-11-17 13:29 consolers        ugh point and click artists
2008-11-17 13:29 jordanb          I think you'd have to have a pretty insanely narrow depth of field, or an extrememly wide angle of view, before that becomes a factor.
2008-11-17 13:29 jordanb          And I think the fact that the object of interest is three dimensional will become a factor first.
2008-11-17 13:30 jordanb          Assuming you're not taking pictures of 2d objects..
2008-11-17 13:30 snogglethorpe    typically in such situations, it's only possible to keep small parts of the object in focus anyway
2008-11-17 13:30 jordanb          Are you sure you're not moving the camera closer or further away when you try to do the framing?
2008-11-17 13:30 snogglethorpe    [a classic example is a picture where a plane through the subject's eyes is in focus, but much of the face is not]
2008-11-17 13:30 jordanb          That sounds more likely.
2008-11-17 13:31 jordanb          snogglethorpe; I've never seen that done.
2008-11-17 13:31 snogglethorpe    jordanb: well i'm pretty careful; but the perturbation from the image-plane/focus-sphere differentce would be greater than any movement anyway
2008-11-17 13:31 jordanb          Well, I think you're wrong. But this is getting tedious.

2008-11-18 10:37 leo2007          it is not his intention to steal your code

2008-11-18 10:55 bonhoffer        something is automatically in my emacs version
2008-11-18 10:56 consolers        yeah this is a separate package

2008-11-18 10:56 bonhoffer        so acutex is much better?
2008-11-18 10:56 e1f              all ancient cultures have stories about the end of the world (eschatology). now if we consider emacs an ancient culture, does it have such stories.
2008-11-18 10:56 memnon           bonhoffer: auctex is recommended by *lots* of people
2008-11-18 10:56 consolers        no, but it does 1001 things more than what emacs ships with
2008-11-18 10:57 consolers        ,praise emacs

2008-11-18 10:57 memnon           bonhoffer: Actually, it seems to be the best out there! Lots of people recommend to new latex users to learn emacs just for auctex.

2008-11-18 11:42 memnon           Someone was wondering if he would ever learn 10% of the Emacs keystrokes. He did not realise than pre-made keystrokes are only a small part of all available commands. And then, that all available commands are only a small part of all available functions. And, of course, that all of the above is only a small drop in the ocean of possibilities given by the extensible properties of Emacs. At times, I wonder if this should be seen as

2008-11-18 12:11 memnon           snogglethorpe: ?? fetch mail. There is not that much to do. I don't know getmail, so I have no comparison, but so far, I found fetchmail simple an reliable.
2008-11-18 12:12 memnon           Well, for now I use external programs to do all time consuming tasks and use emacs to access them. rss2email, fetchmail, leafnode etc. This works so far.
2008-11-18 12:12 yonkeltron       snogglethorpe: how do you mean?
2008-11-18 12:13 ManateeLazyCat   rwanderley: Icicle is great and except that author customize many key bind to replace default keystroke.
2008-11-18 12:13 snogglethorpe    yonkeltron: there's a biggish thread from a year or two ago about the subject, but the conclusion seemed to be that a form of non-preemptive threading would be workable and practical for emacs to use (including compatibility with old elisp code)
2008-11-18 12:13 yonkeltron       snogglethorpe: right, merge in lexbind, then go for coroutines...
2008-11-18 12:13 ManateeLazyCat   memnon: Leafnode is good for fetch news with Gnus, I always read 50 newsgroup with Gnus and speed is fast :)
2008-11-18 12:14 snogglethorpe    yonkeltron: the important thing is that most of the major emacs developers were involved, and there seemed to be a general agreement that it was doable, at least in a future version
2008-11-18 12:14 rwanderley       ManateeLazyCat: yes, I will try it out for a few days, and than I can give some feedback.
2008-11-18 12:15 ManateeLazyCat   rwanderley: Are you use "(setq icicle-top-level-key-bindings nil)" to disable default keystroke of icicles? 
2008-11-18 12:15 memnon           I heard some people run gnus in a separate emacs, just because of the speed issue. But that is no practical solution IMO. This takes away a crucial advantage of emacs.

2008-11-18 12:37 consolers        i thought maybe it was a 127.0.0.1 <-> localhost issue
2008-11-18 12:38 consolers        yeah i'm running the listener program  (i didnt  write it)
2008-11-18 12:38 snogglethorpe    consolers: there was some weirdness with the name "localhost" in debian a while back
2008-11-18 12:39 johnsu01         yes
2008-11-18 12:39 johnsu01         ipv6 weirdness
2008-11-18 12:39 snogglethorpe    some config stuff was mucking up the name
2008-11-18 12:39 consolers        maybe thats just come to this box
2008-11-18 12:39 snogglethorpe    consolers: do you have a localhost entry in /etc/hosts?
2008-11-18 12:39 consolers        this is an ubuntu 8.04 box
2008-11-18 12:39 consolers        etc/hosts was modified at last reboot
2008-11-18 12:39 snogglethorpe    oh that's clever
2008-11-18 12:39 consolers        which is when my problems started
2008-11-18 12:40 consolers        no it looks fine.
2008-11-18 12:40 consolers        emacs 22 works. emacs 23 doesnt!
2008-11-18 12:40 consolers        blah
2008-11-18 12:40 snogglethorpe    so does netstat show emacs is listening?
2008-11-18 12:40 consolers        let me double check on names and use localhost instead
2008-11-18 12:41 consolers        netstat is fine it shows the listening port until emacs connects
2008-11-18 12:41 consolers        the minute emacs connects it gets a closed process

2008-11-18 15:29 rgr_             (or w3m-minor-mode)

2008-11-18 15:31 ManateeLazyCat   rgr_: I think Gnus just use the render method of w3m-mode but not load w3m-mode. So you just bind speical key that you like in article-mode.
2008-11-18 15:32 rgr_             yeah. Thats how it is now. As I say, worked fine.

2008-11-18 15:41 consolers        i'm not going to answer your question
2008-11-18 15:42 consolers        not now anyway
2008-11-18 15:42 alephnull        Feel free to leave me a memo.
2008-11-18 15:43 ManateeLazyCat   rgr_: Likes "w3m-get-buffer-with-org-style", beginning i just want to use terminal in Emacs is simple, I think multi-term is very useful for Emacs newbie. So when FSF send my PDF document, i will send this extension to develop list.
2008-11-18 15:43 consolers        do you have a routing entry for lo snogglethorpe ?

2008-11-18 15:44 snogglethorpe    why on earth would there be one for lo?
2008-11-18 15:44 consolers        same on this box. but all redhat/suse otehr boxes i've seen had entries for lo
2008-11-18 15:44 rgr_             ManateeLazyCat: your multi-term is a bit confusing though. Not for the newbie I think.

2008-11-18 15:45 consolers        i have no idea if this is a problem
2008-11-18 15:46 consolers        but emacs-23's open-network-stream always leads to the connection being dropped and its not a problem on the server's side
2008-11-18 15:46 consolers        its either emacs or the OS that is closing the socket
2008-11-18 15:46 rgr_             ManateeLazyCat: terms in general are confusing IMO. Dont forget issues with keys not working etc.
2008-11-18 15:46 snogglethorpe    consolers: what about an strace of emacs?
2008-11-18 15:46 consolers        i'll try that tomorrow
2008-11-18 15:46 consolers        wasted enough time today
2008-11-18 15:47 ManateeLazyCat   rgr_: I remember, i saw your write in EmacsWiki about "w3m-get-buffer-with-org-style", but this have problem, is some functions that "w3m-get-buffer-with-org-style" need you can't write, so if someone get this function and can't work, because those functions that "w3m-get-buffer-org-sytle" need is write by myself, not in emacs-w3m.

2008-11-21 19:08 LaoLang_cool     ok, but I think the kernel of an OS is a kernel :)
2008-11-21 19:08 overdrive        LaoLang_cool: no, the main difference between editors like vi/vim and emacs is that emacs is an *environment*, that includes an editor
2008-11-21 19:09 LaoLang_cool     overdrive: yes, exactly
2008-11-21 19:09 LaoLang_cool     So why not includes a locker :)
2008-11-21 19:09 overdrive        best example probably is e.g. you could read pdf in emacs, not in other editors
2008-11-21 19:10 DomQ             Found it, for the record:
2008-11-21 19:10 consolers        how that works is  an abomination that i havent gotten over yet

2008-11-21 19:10 DomQ             actually abort-recursive-edit *does* work, but it deletes the contents of the *Backtrace* buffer afterwards
2008-11-21 19:11 DomQ             (supposedly to prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot)
2008-11-21 19:11 overdrive        LaoLang_cool: well, same example, emacs could read pdf, but not edit pdf, this is very specific, forthis reason is not included, but normally, if the feature does not exist, try to find, if not ask somebody to do, if not you could try to develop this feature :-)
2008-11-21 19:11 DomQ             I whipped up a function that reinstates *Backtrace*, bound it to C-M-] and voila.

2008-11-21 19:34 consolers        or stick a require 'ibuffer before the setq
2008-11-21 19:34 consolers        no that wont help
2008-11-21 19:34 consolers        no idea
2008-11-21 19:36 sybariten        i have copied a big chunk of text from one buffer.... using alt-w

2008-11-21 19:36 sybariten        whats the analogy of selecting a long text (in the wonderful windows world) and pasting over a selection? (replacing)
2008-11-21 19:36 consolers        select the region M-x delete-region then C-y
2008-11-21 19:37 sybariten        okay thanks

2008-11-21 23:10 MightyWolfeagle  I do a lot of work on the university solaris machine that's running a pretty outdated version of emacs (19.22.1).  I'd like to show line numbers along the left hand side, however linum.el doesn't seem to work with a version of emacs that old.  Is there a .el file (I'm not sure what those are called in the emacs universe) that would work for me?

2008-11-22 18:33 rgr              I'm playing with iPython integration with emacs. Works well. But one of the python buffer commands "execute buffer" sends its contents to the iPython interpreter and leaves the focus in the interpreter. Would this be a good time to use defadvice to somehow force focus back to the python buffer itself? How is the best way here?

2008-11-26 22:41 fledermaus       the argument isn't optional
2008-11-26 22:41 fledermaus       in the second form, you do not supply it.
2008-11-26 22:41 fledermaus       and \C notation is obsolete.

2008-11-27 11:22 jordanb          Looking at the wikipedia page on geometric progresion, it's obvious it's a polynomial.

2008-11-27 11:22 bpalmer          I see. It depends on whether you're analyzing it as a function of n or r
2008-11-27 11:22 zmonx            compound interest is exponential: it means that in year N, you have X^N
2008-11-27 11:23 zmonx            starting with fixed amount N

2008-11-27 11:23 zmonx            yes, that's what we are talking about: it grows exponentially in time
2008-11-27 11:23 ggole            "The behaviour of a geometric sequence depends on the value of the common ratio.
2008-11-27 11:23 ggole            If the common ratio is: ...Greater than 1, there will be exponential growth towards positive infinity."
2008-11-27 11:23 bpalmer          sorry, t is the important thing; n in that is just how often it's compounded.

2008-11-27 11:25 cluck            twb: afaik "exponential" could be applied to any function that plots a certain type of graph, the power itself is negligible since any number (refering usually to non 0 positive integers) will conform to a certain graphical pattern
2008-11-27 11:25 twb              To answer my question (thanks to #math), the exponent comes in when you define f:t in absolute terms, rather than in terms of the previous time increment (t-1).

2008-11-27 12:14 Cowmoo           much respect no doubt
2008-11-27 12:14 ggole            That was fast
2008-11-27 12:15 Cowmoo           oh I didn't debug elisp, problem lied outside it 
2008-11-27 12:15 Cowmoo           it was caused by OS X setting my hostname to blah.local
2008-11-27 12:15 Cowmoo           while I thought it was 'blah'
2008-11-27 12:16 ggole            So why did that hang emacs?
2008-11-27 12:16 retroj           /part #emacs "Channel buffer killed"
2008-11-27 12:20 Cowmoo           haha
2008-11-27 12:20 Cowmoo           ok fine, that part is probably due to bug in elisp...it should just report the error and not hang
2008-11-27 12:20 Cowmoo           it actulaly was reported in *Messages*...I ran regular terminal emacs, it hanged there but C-g stopped it
2008-11-27 12:20 Cowmoo           (before, I was in Carbon Emacs)
2008-11-27 12:20 Cowmoo           so in vanilla terminal emacs, once C-g worked, I checked *Messages*, and it said can't find hostname blah
2008-11-27 12:20 Cowmoo           so then my suspicions were aroused! Which led to success
2008-11-27 12:20 ggole            I'm not sure whether you should report that or not

2008-11-27 12:20 Cowmoo           and obviously since thigns work fine,I'm not motivated to investigate :(

2008-11-27 13:12 e1f              the only reason i can thonk of for using bonjour for windows is if you are sharing a windows printer to a mac
2008-11-27 13:12 offby1           no, I'm just curious -- I have a printer on my Ubuntu box and was wondering if the Windows box would "see" it
2008-11-27 13:13 offby1           Ubuntu has "avahi", which I think talks the same talk what Bonjour talks.
2008-11-27 13:13 e1f              ubuntu has to do the sharing unless you're planning on moving the printer to the windows box in which case bonjour would work
2008-11-27 13:14 e1f              bonjour is the new name for zero-conf
2008-11-27 13:14 offby1           so bonjour only helps to _broadcast_ stuff connected to the windows box?  It doesn't help to discover stuff connected to other boxes?

2008-11-27 21:28 ams              nothing more, it doesn't care if you use glibc, bsd libc, or ultrix libc
2008-11-27 21:28 ams              as long as it is a C library
2008-11-27 21:28 a-s              ams: are you sure that is does not use the C support to create tmp files?
2008-11-27 21:29 ams              a-s: as i said, bash does not have any means to create temporary files
2008-11-27 21:29 ams              you must code such a function, or use an external command
2008-11-27 21:30 a-s              yes, I use mktemp. mktemp use glibc support for creating them
2008-11-27 21:30 ams              no
2008-11-27 21:30 ams              it doesn't
2008-11-27 21:30 pgas             well you can create a temporary file and genrate a random number with bash only so I guess you can, but the external command mktemp does a much better job
2008-11-27 21:30 ams              mktemp is infact a command from OpenBSD
2008-11-27 21:31 a-s              you mean that the classical commands like sed, rev, etc do not use glibc ?
2008-11-27 21:31 ams              pgas: sure, but then one could equally argue that emacs supports kernel level drivers... cause it is turing complete
2008-11-27 21:31 ams              a-s: they use whatever C library you have on your system
2008-11-27 21:31 pgas             a-s: you cannot make an aribtrary C call using bash only
2008-11-27 21:31 ams              the GNU C library is one of many C libraries, and sed, coreutils, and emacs run on multiple platforms with different libc's, some which are not glibc
2008-11-27 21:32 a-s              the glibc shared library
2008-11-27 21:32 a-s              ams: what you say I know.
2008-11-27 21:32 ams              a-s: then stop insisting that sed, bash, etc use glibc
2008-11-27 21:32 ams              they don't
2008-11-27 21:32 ams              they depend only on posix

2008-11-27 21:33 a-s              ans you said that there is no such support.
2008-11-27 21:33 ams              because there isn't

2009-01-05 16:45 Coke             thanks mate

2009-01-05 16:45 Coke             pgas: do you think emacs authors try really hard to make it difficult for users to use it?
2009-01-05 16:45 pgas             no
2009-01-05 16:45 Coke             or is it just a coincidence? :)
2009-01-05 16:46 Coke             how can a format line be anything but a simple format line? :) I truly don't get it.
2009-01-05 16:47 Coke             Sometimes I think to myself "such an easy setting to change in any crap editor, requires 2 hours and +10,000 lines of emacs lisp code, I should change editor", but then I look at the alternatives and M-x revert-mind-buffer back to emacs
2009-01-05 16:50 Coke             To be honest, I don't even understand where I'm supposed to put the %f

2009-01-05 16:51 nunag            I wish people would get this straight. Emacs is not a productivity tool. The whole point of it is to waste a lot of time and have a lot of fun dicking with elisp. That is why it is so loved
2009-01-05 16:51 pgas             Coke: ok the %b is in here C-h v mode-line-buffer-identification

2009-01-30 14:05 spiderbyte       when i see "Reading at buffer position 1295" in my backtrace, how do I navigate to view that position within a file?

2009-01-30 14:05 spiderbyte       so i don't know what that refers to
2009-01-30 14:06 spiderbyte       would `C-u 1295 C-f` be thinking in the wrong direction?
2009-01-30 14:06 bpalmer          that's the right direction, but M-x goto-char RET 1295 RET is easier
2009-01-30 14:06 bpalmer          (the C-f bit would work modulo an off-by-one situation, if you make sure to start at the beginning of the file)
