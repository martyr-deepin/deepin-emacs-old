2008-10-31 20:27 tic              You can.
2008-10-31 20:28 lispm            I can report that we had 10 people at the last Lisp meeting in Hamburg , this time at the Fachhochschule in Wedel
2008-10-31 20:28 lispm            Gilbert Baumann was there, too!
2008-10-31 20:29 tic              I don't know of him. Famous?
2008-10-31 20:29 lispm            he wrote a full web browser in Common Lisp
2008-10-31 20:29 lispm            for example

2008-10-31 20:29 lispm            I gave a CLIM 'presentation'
2008-10-31 20:30 tic              Closer, or what it's called?
2008-10-31 20:30 lispm            for those interested slides are here:
2008-10-31 20:30 lispm            http://lispm.dyndns.org/presentation/mcclim-20081029/
2008-10-31 20:30 tic              Oh, nice!
2008-10-31 20:30 lispm            the web browser is called 'closure'
2008-10-31 20:30 nurv             /nick nurv101
2008-10-31 20:32 tic              Closure, right. I was going to say Clo[szj]ure, because I couldn't remember which one it was. =)
2008-10-31 20:32 tic              closure uses clim right?
2008-10-31 20:32 lispm            yes, mcclim

2008-10-31 20:33 tic              lispm, do McCLIM and CLIM differ in spec?
2008-10-31 20:33 lichtblau        lispm: I see in that presentation that you found only clim-clx to be usable.
2008-10-31 20:33 lichtblau        Which aspects of clim-gtkairo did you find most lacking?
2008-10-31 20:33 lnxz             /quit Client Quit
2008-10-31 20:34 lispm            I'm waiting for a Lisp project named 'clochard'
2008-10-31 20:35 lispm            lichtblau, I guess that's my lack of experience with clim-gtkairo
2008-10-31 20:35 lispm            is it usable? How do I use it?
2008-10-31 20:35 lispm            tic: McCLIM is a 'free' implementation of the CLIM spec
2008-10-31 20:36 lispm            lichtblau, what do I need to get clim-gtkairo running?
2008-10-31 20:36 tic              lispm, OK.

2008-10-31 20:40 lispm            I see some instructions for clim-gtkairo on the McCLIM wiki
2008-10-31 20:40 lispm            I have to try that at some later time...
2008-10-31 20:41 e271             For restarts, is there some way to "cancel" them before they are invoked?
2008-10-31 20:41 lispm            I also wanted to compiler McCLIM with CMUCL on my Mac, but ran into one or two compiler errors (seem to be errors in CMUCL)
2008-10-31 20:42 e271             i.e. de-register them from COMPUTE-RESTARTS?
2008-10-31 20:43 lichtblau        lispm: gtkairo certainly has many bugs (as well as mere incompatibilities).  I was just curious whether you had perhaps come across specific bugs that you found particularly annoying.
2008-10-31 20:44 lispm            lichtblau, I should check that out
2008-10-31 20:44 lispm            I also want to try the current 'beagle' backend
2008-10-31 20:44 locklace         chandler: the locative trick was interesting, is there a good tutorial or source of information on using the more esoteric CL tools to create new language features like that?
2008-10-31 20:45 chandler         minion: tell locklace about On Lisp
2008-10-31 20:45 minion           locklace: have a look at On Lisp: by Paul Graham An advanced textbook on Common Lisp, with special focus on macros. http://www.cliki.net/On%20Lisp
2008-10-31 20:46 locklace         ok, guess it's time to re-read that ;)
2008-10-31 20:47 lispm            strange idea: CLIM does not provide a window system, it provides a gui interface for Common Lisp - but it uses the underlying window system of the platform
2008-10-31 20:48 lispm            idea: 1a) implement a window system with McCLIM
2008-10-31 20:48 lispm            idea: 1b) implement a (X11) window manager with McCLIM

2008-10-31 20:58 tic              yeah, but StumpWM's beauty is that its out of your way. only draws minimal frames around windows.
2008-10-31 20:58 tic              (or none at all)
2008-10-31 20:59 lispm            well, I would opt for a window manager with similar capabilities, but with a different user interface
2008-10-31 20:59 lichtblau        tic: haha, that's obviously for a value of "beauty" that sounds very CLIM-compatible
2008-10-31 20:59 tic              stumpwm is largely keyboard driven. :)
2008-10-31 20:59 tic              lichtblau, :)
2008-10-31 21:00 lispm            if you look at DW, the inspiration for clim, it is very barebones, too
2008-10-31 21:00 tic              I mean that you don't really _see_ much of it at all. you have a prompt, ok, but that's really trivial.  Not to say I wouldn't like it, I just fail to see the point.
2008-10-31 21:00 lispm            full screen windows with minimal borders, etc.
2008-10-31 21:00 Xach             lispm: i love quips like "Dynamic Windows is a great improvement over its successors."
2008-10-31 21:00 lispm            largely keyboard driven

2008-10-31 21:01 lispm            Xach, unfortunately there is some truth to it
2008-10-31 21:01 dlowe            My only complaint about the tiling window managers (including stumpwm) is the lack of decent notification mechanisms
2008-10-31 21:01 tic              dlowe, define notification
2008-10-31 21:02 dlowe            tic: if I get an IM, or someone says my name on IRC, or I get an email, I want some sort of blip. If I'm running in full-screen mode, I always have this nagging suspicion that I'm missing something
2008-10-31 21:03 tic              dlowe, full-screen? you said tiling! :) no problems there. moreover, stumpwm has hooks for that stuff.
2008-10-31 21:03 tic              (besides, I run gnome-panel together with stumpwm, so I get notifications through that)
2008-10-31 21:04 tic              any netwm-capable wm has hooks for notification.
2008-10-31 21:04 lispm            that's why the Lispm window system had a line at the bottom reserved for these kinds of things (progress bars, ...)

2008-10-31 21:05 tomoyuki28jp     There is no function like booleanp?  This is enough? (defun booleanp (x) (when (member x '(t nil)) t))

2008-10-31 22:32 nikodemus`       there's a patch on sbcl-devel that makes it work, and makes compile-file prepend the #! line automatically -- but it's a bad idea
2008-10-31 22:32 nikodemus`       imo
2008-10-31 22:33 nikodemus`       or at least the second part is
2008-10-31 22:33 Xach             that implementation strategy doesn't sound so great
2008-10-31 22:33 nikodemus`       because upgrading sbcl breaks fasl compatibility, and therefor all your compiled scripts

2008-10-31 22:42 tic              Ah, query parameters avoids that. Hm. robots.txt or per-engine blocking in the request handler?
2008-10-31 22:42 Xach             probably robots.txt. query parameters doesn't really avoid it here in 2008

2008-10-31 22:43 tic              Xach, OK, I thought you meant the current URL (as opposed to /search/foo) was to avoid search engines.

2008-10-31 22:48 Xach             ok, i take that back. LOAD uses an implementation-specific mechanism to decide whether to load source or fasl. not sure if it's documented in sbcl.
2008-10-31 22:48 nikodemus`       iirc it's not
2008-10-31 22:48 person5          /join 
2008-10-31 22:49 nikodemus`       but (load "foo.lisp") will always load the source, and (load "foo.fasl") will always load the fasl
2008-10-31 22:50 nikodemus`       if you say (load "foo"), and both "foo.lisp" and "foo.fasl" exist, and the fasl is newer, it is loaded
2008-10-31 22:50 stassats`        and what if "foo" exists?
2008-10-31 22:50 nikodemus`       if the source is newer, iirc you get an error with a couple restarts that allow you to choose the one you want
2008-10-31 22:50 nikodemus`       if it exists, it is loaded
2008-10-31 22:50 kreuter          if "foo" exists, we look for a fasl header string in it.

2008-10-31 22:56 kreuter          er, I meant if you have source in a file named foo.fasl.

2008-11-03 19:59 cmm              another option is using a trial version of one of the commercial implementations.  they come with IDEs (at least on Windows)

2008-11-03 20:43 fusss            kiuma: if ed was aware of the syntactic/semantic structure of the documents i was editing and giving good and flexible views of them
2008-11-03 20:43 weirdo           tic, how about interfacing with existing swank code? it has compatibility code for autodoc, xref and all the other goodness

2008-11-03 20:44 fusss            Riastradh: not the semantics, not to the extent i would like, but CL it's pretty kick ass
2008-11-03 20:44 fusss            slime that is
2008-11-03 20:44 H4ns             kiuma: that might be true, my argument is:  if you know a text editor really well, you don't need so much special-purpose hand-holding that any ide may provide
2008-11-03 20:45 Riastradh        fusss, aha, so you're talking about state of the Lisp image with which you're interacting, not the structure of documents.
2008-11-03 20:45 kiuma            H4ns, yes it depends from a lot of factors indeed
2008-11-03 20:45 H4ns             kiuma: i am not trying to convince you that this is a universal argument.  i just happen to switch languages and environments a lot, and no special-purpose ide would be unintrusive enough to support the seamless switching that i have with emacs.
2008-11-03 20:46 kiuma            and this it true too

2008-11-06 01:40 xan_             hunchentoot question in case anybody knows: I'm adding reCaptcha to a page, and to verify the data I need to do a POST request to the reCaptcha servers from my server. But if I use sync APIs (like drakma?) I'll block the whole server while verifying the data, which looks wrong. The 'obvious' fix would be to do this in a thread, but I can't find a way to mix hunchentoot handlers and threads when the handler reply depends on something computed on the thread.

2008-11-08 23:08 nyef             I came to the conclusion yesterday that a label and a label+offset are reasonable things to want to use as addresses for a load/store instruction.

2008-11-09 22:01 beach            rswarbrick: I don't know the answer, but I can guess.  Some strings, like base-strings contain characters that can be represented in a single byte, whereas others can contain unicode characters requiring 24 or 32 bits.  Apparently, in order to inline POSITION, it needs to know which one.

2008-11-11 09:42 fusss            newlisp could lose the l-word and be perfect non-lisp language :-)
2008-11-11 09:43 fusss            most of the small "foo lisp" type language are just block-structured languages with s-exp syntax
2008-11-11 09:45 rvirding         ah, but what do you need to be a real lisp then?

2008-11-11 09:46 rvirding         henry baker did soemthing similar but called it linear lisp
2008-11-11 09:48 fusss            rvirding: not having first class closures and lexical scoping is a good defenition for a non-new lisp

2008-11-11 09:49 rvirding         ok, i'm safe then :-) I have done lfe, lisp flavoured erlang and it has closures and lexical scoping, macros too
2008-11-11 09:49 pkhuong          rvirding: yes. But the copying was an exposition artefact. Any reasonable implementation would be based on some sort of reference counting, not deep copying everywhere.
2008-11-11 09:50 rvirding         the smart bit was the copying so you didn't need a ref count

2008-11-11 09:51 rvirding         but you did have to be a bit smart in the compiler
2008-11-11 09:51 pkhuong          the smart bit was using (lossy, e.g. 1 bit & sticky) ref count to detect when you didn't need to copy.

2008-11-11 09:58 rvirding         iirc baker did copy, must check his paper again. but it is a cool algorithm

2008-11-11 21:40 antifuchs        because sbcl expects a consistently non-broken lisp, and clisp doesn't like to be that
2008-11-11 21:40 jsnell           if I somebody knew why, it would be fixed
2008-11-11 21:40 jsnell           as it is, some versions of clisp will be able to compile sbcl at high tide on thursdays
2008-11-11 21:40 TauPan           *lol*
2008-11-11 21:41 jsnell           and will fail at other times, in ways that are basically impossible to debug
2008-11-11 21:41 luis             ISTR it worked once for me on linux/x86-64
2008-11-11 21:42 jsnell           right. but it working in rare cases still essentially means that it doesn't work
2008-11-11 21:42 jsnell           and it'd better to just be up front about it not working, than have people waste time trying to use clisp as the host
2008-11-11 21:43 jsnell           (is there still documentation around claiming that it works?)
2008-11-11 21:43 luis             yes, agreed. Should have stressed that it worked *once*.
2008-11-11 21:43 TauPan           ah, found the log file

2008-11-11 21:43 TauPan           well, the sbcl README/INSTALL don't really specify that it does/does not work.
2008-11-11 21:44 jsnell           I distinctly remember removing it from the list of supported build hosts in that file
2008-11-11 21:44 jsnell           but you're right, it doesn't list all the non-supported host lisps as non-supported :-)
2008-11-11 21:44 TauPan           yes, it's not in the list of supported platforms
2008-11-11 21:45 TauPan           but I didn't read all the way down *blush*
2008-11-11 21:45 TauPan           unfortunately clisp is the only lisp available as rpm for openSUSE 10.3... I could install a binary sbcl and build from that, I suppose.
2008-11-11 21:49 TauPan           hm, or I could apply the workaround from yesterdays log
2008-11-11 21:49 nyef             TauPan: In fact, you could build from an sbcl binary distribution without installing it, just running it from where you unpacked the tarball.
2008-11-11 21:50 TauPan           sh make.sh 'sh /somewhere/else/run-sbcl.sh'

2008-11-11 21:56 TauPan           hmm, no
2008-11-11 21:56 TauPan           'run-sbcl.sh needs to be run from the top of the SBCL source tree...'
2008-11-11 21:57 nyef             So use /path/to/src/runtime/sbcl --core /path/to/output/sbcl.core instead.
2008-11-11 21:57 nyef             You may need quotes on that, though.

2008-11-12 08:39 hefner           my feelings are simply that first and foremost there ought to be straightforward wrappers for things like posix and sockets syscalls, independent of any huge ambitious libraries with unbounded scope that want to build on top of them
2008-11-12 08:40 hefner           which seems to follow logically from having a portable ffi
2008-11-12 08:41 hefner           but instead, no one really bothers, and said infrastructure gets rolled into the bottom layer of iolib or the like, whether you want the rest or not
2008-11-12 08:41 hefner           including the laundry list of random protocols it aspires to some day implement
2008-11-12 08:41 fe[nl]ix         yes, but the definition of "straightforward" can vary greatly

2008-11-12 09:15 pkhuong          inetic: no, as long as you've left the debugger. Assuming a single threaded lisp, SWANK can't really handle more input if it's still handling the debugger.
2008-11-12 09:15 pkhuong          as for debug locations, if space or speed is too high or debug at 0, you might not get them.

2008-11-12 09:29 Quadrescence     Something like that?
2008-11-12 09:29 Quadrescence     ._.
2008-11-12 09:29 jfm3             Oh.
2008-11-12 09:29 jfm3             Well, you write code into a file, load it into the repl, and then re-eval pieces of it as you go with the editor.
2008-11-12 09:29 oudeis           /quit "This computer has gone to sleep"
2008-11-12 09:31 jfm3             You wind up doing little informal unit tests as you go with the repl.
2008-11-12 09:31 Quadrescence     jfm3: So, should I be only editing/typing in a single buffer?
2008-11-12 09:31 jfm3             I usually have a few .lisp files in buffers, and another buffer with the interactive SLIME session.
2008-11-12 09:32 jfm3             And by "interactive SLIME session" I mean a useful skin over the usual SBCL REPL.
2008-11-12 09:32 Quadrescence     Hum.
2008-11-12 09:32 Quadrescence     Right.
2008-11-12 09:33 jfm3             C-x C-e on a defun in a lisp-mode buffer will redefun that defun through SLIME, for example.

2008-11-12 09:35 jfm3             From time to time, you will make the running Lisp image so borked that it will be easier to restart it than to fix it manually.  In this case you type ,quit at the slime repl, and reload your source.

2008-11-12 09:37 Quadrescence     jfm3: I went through http://mypage.iu.edu/~colallen/lp/lp.html entirely. Now I am reading PAIP.
2008-11-12 09:37 jfm3             Nice.
2008-11-12 09:37 jfm3             You might benefit from the PCL chapter on setting up Emacs and the rest of the usual development environment.
2008-11-12 09:38 jfm3             PAIP is on my list.
2008-11-12 09:38 Quadrescence     I'll take a look. I did also install emacs/slime, went through the tutorial and all.
2008-11-12 09:38 Quadrescence     (and I have it open, of course, as we speak)
2008-11-12 09:39 jfm3             There are other ways to do it, but most free Lispers use UNIX and Emacs.  The other ways involve some vim or Eclipse stuff that I don't know a lot about, but I would imagine they document how they expect to be used pretty well.
2008-11-12 09:40 Quadrescence     Meh, I'll really try to get the hang of emacs.
2008-11-12 09:41 Quadrescence     People insist it will be worth it.
2008-11-12 09:42 merlincorey      Quadrescence: it will, trust me
2008-11-12 09:42 jfm3             I would count myself among those people :)
2008-11-12 09:43 merlincorey      Quadrescence: I was once all butterfingers with emacs and always opening new buffers I didn't want in fun new ways
2008-11-12 09:43 merlincorey      Quadrescence: eventually I decided to put my frustration up front and center and use nothing but emacs for a bit until I GOT IT.
2008-11-12 09:44 Quadrescence     merlincorey: I went through your first stage. Hopefully I'm at your second stage.
2008-11-12 09:44 merlincorey      Quadrescence: once gaining a bit of a baseline skill and knowledge with it there, it turned into a very productive tool for me.  Then I started messing with slime.  It totally spoiled me as far as a programming editor/environment - just like Lisp itself spoiled me as far as a programming language.
2008-11-12 09:45 merlincorey      Quadrescence: the best part is at least with where I am at now, I am comfortable with the functionality I know, and I learn new thgs vfairly regularly that improve it even more! :)

2008-11-12 09:49 jfm3             Emacs feels weird until your fingers learn a few keystrokes and you have had a few calm trips through the manual/s.  emacswiki.org helps.
2008-11-12 09:53 merlincorey      certain chords are very useful as well, such as C-h b
2008-11-12 09:54 stassats         C-h in general is very helpful

2008-11-12 09:57 merlincorey      Quadrescence: I read some good advice on a blog some time ago...  you can't take IN an entire reference card at once, it just can't be done
2008-11-12 09:57 Quadrescence     Well of course.
2008-11-12 09:57 merlincorey      Quadrescence: their suggestion was to have a post-it nearby with the 5-10 commands you are trying to learn RIGHT NOW
2008-11-12 09:57 merlincorey      and just change that list as you learn them
2008-11-12 09:58 Quadrescence     merlincorey: That's what I sort of do mentally.
2008-11-12 09:58 merlincorey      (I think its a decent technique, and I've been trying it, but with a digital post-it)

2008-11-12 10:01 Quadrescence     Lisp is making me "wtf" every 10 seconds.
2008-11-12 10:02 Quadrescence     Does slime have any auto-indenting?
2008-11-12 10:03 Quadrescence     And, err, maybe "tack on all the parentheses you need"-ing?
2008-11-12 10:03 DrForr           autoindent is <tab>, IIRC.
2008-11-12 10:03 Quadrescence     DrForr: I kind found that out. Thanks.

2008-11-12 10:10 Quadrescence     I think it would be cool if the (forgets formal name) description of the buffer contained (parentheses open - par. closed) to the left of the cursor.
2008-11-12 10:10 hefner           can you elaborate?

2008-11-12 10:14 Quadrescence     (defun power (x y) (if (= y 0) 1 (* x (power x |(1- y))))) would display 6-2 = +4
2008-11-12 10:14 sellout          Quadrescence: Oh, you want to know the depth at point.
2008-11-12 10:14 Quadrescence     sellout: I'm just saying it would be interesting I guess.

2008-11-17 21:52 H4ns             you cannot "add a slash" to the end of a path name.  as far as the cl pathname system is considered, a directory and a file are two different things and you cannot change a file into a directory by string manipulating the pathname object
2008-11-17 21:52 H4ns             you can certainly serialize the pathname into a string, manipulate that and then turn the string into a pathname again.

2008-11-17 22:48 nyef             So it occurred to me last night, ARM is probably going to be the first optionally-soft-float SBCL port.
2008-11-17 22:48 kzar             I've pretty much finished my little script but I'm getting an error now that I'm testing it on real pages "the character with code 8211 cannot be encoded.". It gives me the option to skip the character interactively but do you know if there's a way to do this automatically? (This is going to run from a cron-job so it can't really require input from me.)
2008-11-17 22:48 nyef             (I say optionally because the Architecture Reference Manual (ARM) defined an FPU, but it's not implemented on the XScale.)
2008-11-17 22:49 nyef             kzar: Typically, you handler-bind the actual error and use invoke-restart.
2008-11-17 22:49 Krystof          Quadrescence: you may, but I'll only respond if it's interesting
2008-11-17 22:50 nyef             Anyway, soft-float appears to use completely different conventions from the VFP, and apparently doesn't do excetions -at all-, so that's going to be interesting. May even have to have a separate soft-float library for SBCL.

2008-11-18 11:55 beach            lelelele: What brings you to #lisp?
2008-11-18 11:56 lelelele         learning languages history
2008-11-18 11:56 lelelele         ?
2008-11-18 11:56 lelelele         I am trying to understand how perl could be influenced of lisp.
2008-11-18 11:56 lelelele         Before I was learning this language history, I though PERL was smth amazing, cause people in #PERL seemed so hackers-like.
2008-11-18 11:57 beach            lelelele: pretty much everything was influenced by Lisp.
2008-11-18 11:57 lelelele         no
2008-11-18 11:58 lelelele         Lisp (or LISP) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized syntax. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today; only Fortran is older.
2008-11-18 11:59 lelelele         But they forgot about ALGOL
2008-11-18 12:00 stassats`        wow, is it still in use?
2008-11-18 12:00 lelelele         sorry
2008-11-18 12:00 lelelele         yes it is in use
2008-11-18 12:01 lelelele         but it belongs to FORTRAN.
2008-11-18 12:01 lelelele         so you are right.
2008-11-18 12:01 lelelele         LISP and FORTRAN.
2008-11-18 12:01 lelelele         two stories.
2008-11-18 12:01 lelelele         you got perl/ruby/schema/common lisp etc

2008-11-18 12:01 lelelele         and they got many C, JAWA smth like that
2008-11-18 12:02 lelelele         also COBOL etc in their disposal.
2008-11-18 12:02 stassats`        ok, what do you want to say?
2008-11-18 12:02 beach            lelelele: OK, sticking to the topic of #lisp, do you have any questions?
2008-11-18 12:02 lelelele         I want to understand.
2008-11-18 12:02 phadthai         "their disposal"?
2008-11-18 12:03 lelelele         beach : yes, what language you use?
2008-11-18 12:03 lelelele         Common lisp? Schema? Perl?
2008-11-18 12:03 lelelele         So many lisp influenced, I don't understand what difference.
2008-11-18 12:03 beach            lelelele: #lisp is mostly about Common Lisp, so that's what pretty much everyone uses here.
2008-11-18 12:03 lelelele         ok
2008-11-18 12:03 lelelele         good!
2008-11-18 12:03 lelelele         This is old good lisp.

Thus, the were able to push the language to its limits, but the stopped before making a single decision that would make it hard to write a compiler that generates very efficient code.

2008-11-18 12:14 lelelele         beach: and how is different lisp and common lisp?
2008-11-18 12:14 lelelele         I mean oldest lisp and common lisp?
2008-11-18 12:15 beach            lelelele: When we say Lisp, we usually mean Common Lisp.
2008-11-18 12:15 beach            lelelele: They are very different languages indeed.
2008-11-18 12:15 lelelele         new lisp is written in Text, old lisp is done on an abicus.
2008-11-18 12:15 lelelele         how is in real?
2008-11-18 12:15 lelelele         I would like to learn Old LISP.
2008-11-18 12:15 lelelele         and FORTRAN.
2008-11-18 12:16 beach            lelelele: If you look at the features in that list, you will find that Common Lisp has the most sophisticated OO system around.
2008-11-18 12:16 lelelele         I want oldest languages just for logics,not for commerce.
2008-11-18 12:16 lelelele         ok what about old LISP?
2008-11-18 12:16 beach            lelelele: I don't think this channel will be able to help you then.   Come back when you want to know something about Common Lisp.
2008-11-18 12:16 qbg              Would LISP 1.5 be old enough?
2008-11-18 12:17 lelelele         I don't know.
2008-11-18 12:17 lelelele         Common Lisp could be good too.
2008-11-18 12:17 lelelele         if it is alike to old LISP.
2008-11-18 12:17 lelelele         or not less powerful.
2008-11-18 12:17 beach            I just told you that they are very different.
2008-11-18 12:17 qbg              There was a page showing how a LISP 1.5 program runs on Common Lisp with very little changes
2008-11-18 12:17 lelelele         As much different as LISP and Perl?
2008-11-18 12:17 beach            much more
2008-11-18 12:18 lelelele         gosh.....

2008-11-18 12:19 beach            lelelele: I think it is time for you to lurk harder.
2008-11-18 12:19 lelelele         where can I find people used old LISP now then?

2008-11-18 12:21 beach            OK, I need to come up with (at least) one more student projects.  I have already suggested Stamp (Email reader) and a specialized Common Lisp editor.  Any ideas?
2008-11-18 12:22 snopi            can lisp do kerberos authentication through a network protocol?
2008-11-18 12:22 kngspook         stassats: thanks, will do
2008-11-18 12:23 beach            snopi: That question makes no sense, because the langauge doesn't mention networking.
2008-11-18 12:23 snopi            alright, so then can lisp be used with kerberos
2008-11-18 12:23 beach            snopi: I am sure every implementation has what it takes to talk over a network.

2008-11-18 12:26 snopi            what i mean is, is there some implementation of kerberos in lisp? or maybe just a way for a program running by a user with kredentials to pass them on
2008-11-18 12:26 lelelele         beach: any demo programs made on clisp?
2008-11-18 12:27 lelelele         I mean how they run like .exe or like with Runtime ?
2008-11-18 12:28 qbg              lelelele: Are you talking about dumping an executable image?
2008-11-18 12:29 lelelele         yes
2008-11-18 12:29 stassats`        most executables are using some sort of runtime, so your question doesn't make sense
2008-11-18 12:29 lelelele         I mean in Windows
2008-11-18 12:29 uxell            lelelele: you would have to pack nearly the entire lisp system into that image
2008-11-18 12:30 lelelele         can you make executable files for windows XP without any Runtime installing?
2008-11-18 12:30 lelelele         ok
2008-11-18 12:30 lelelele         I see.
2008-11-18 12:30 uxell            lelelele: so you would end up with a very large stand alone .exe
2008-11-18 12:30 phadthai         it can be done however, of course
2008-11-18 12:31 lelelele         So how you marketing your programs?

2008-11-18 12:31 uxell            lelelele: think java vm here. though it can be done, most ppl don't bother. clisp definitely has those capabilities. but I don't remember the function
2008-11-18 12:32 phadthai         some cl implementations compile to C code which you could build with a C compiler, or you could use an implementation which supports executable dumping for your operating system

2008-11-18 12:32 lelelele         so you are saying that with C code windows will "understand"?
2008-11-18 12:32 phadthai         another way is to include a licensed (or open source) lisp runtime with your application
2008-11-18 12:33 beach            lelelele: I recommend you quit using Windows anyway.

2008-11-18 12:35 lelelele         so clisp is open source only?
2008-11-18 12:35 stassats`        clisp is under gpl, but i bet you are referring to common lisp
2008-11-18 12:35 uxell            open source was there before the web, was just not called open source
2008-11-18 12:35 phadthai         however, lisp has more advantages when using it in an open source setting, i.e. it is a self-documenting system where the interactive environment can dynamically extend and access code and documentation
2008-11-18 12:35 lelelele         yes common lisp .
2008-11-18 12:36 lelelele         I want to sell my program as exe for windows

2008-11-18 12:36 kngspook         Is there a built-in list flattening function?  I looked, and can't find one; but it seems like it would be an uncharacteristic omission...
2008-11-18 12:37 uxell            lelelele: the applications will run on the user's system as standalone? no internet connections client/server stuff?
2008-11-18 12:37 stassats`        kngspook: no built-in, but there is one in alexandria

2008-11-18 12:39 lelelele         just it will store data to database

2008-11-18 12:39 lelelele         not from browser but from app:)
2008-11-18 12:39 uxell            lelelele: cause, as the saying goes .exe that's "hello world" ~40MB image, .exe that's an excel ~45MB
2008-11-18 12:40 lelelele         strange
2008-11-18 12:40 lelelele         I used some nicely done programs in  windows, small ones but they were like database programs.
2008-11-18 12:40 lelelele         I am refering to accordia 1.0

2008-11-18 12:41 lelelele         but from 2.0 they did shit, and so they left arena. But I still use first one, cause it is old but fantastic incredible programed.
2008-11-18 12:41 lelelele         dunno what they used maybe C?
2008-11-18 12:41 stassats`        for example, with ecl you can make smaller application
2008-11-18 12:41 uxell            not at all if youi take into account that a lisp system brings much more to the user than just the progam itself. debugger, compiler (on the fly compilation), etc.
2008-11-18 12:42 pkhuong          uxell: the user doesn't care. Let's not pretend that issue doesn't exist.
2008-11-18 12:43 uxell            pkhuong: the user, sure. I was more thinking along the line of the app the user uses has more stuff at it's command

2008-11-18 15:02 kami-            sykopomp: I find among programmers (mostly younger ones who grew up with IDEs) an irrational fear of white text on black background. So, even the ssh terminal scares some of them. Let alone the rest.

2008-11-18 15:03 sykopomp         once he got going and got proper style with them, it was much nicer, but there were points in there where I had no idea where things should go.

2008-11-18 15:06 sykopomp         yeah. The biggest thing that helped, I think, was having emacs' paren matching
2008-11-18 15:06 sykopomp         and, of course, no one would be as excited about lisp if you didn't have a repl to mess around with, so C-c C-c got some big points

2008-11-18 15:18 sykopomp         this guy was originally writing lisp in an editor that did not do syntax highlighting, paren matching, or indenting.

2008-11-18 15:53 Draggor          I think I did report a bug for it, but there were some bindings in insert mode I couldn't change that drove me nuts
2008-11-18 15:53 tic              Oh.
2008-11-18 15:53 Draggor          I should give it a shot again
2008-11-18 15:53 tic              Sorry about that.  I really hope to find the time to work on it.  But Limp in vimscript is a dead-end, I'm aiming for a rewrite in Common Lisp using the ECL-enabled Limp.
2008-11-18 15:54 Draggor          interesting
2008-11-18 15:57 Draggor          I don't have to use vim exactly

2008-11-18 15:57 tic              http://common-lisp.net/project/limp for the patch and two trivial tests.
2008-11-18 15:57 sykopomp         Draggor: of course not. You could use emacs :)

2008-11-18 15:58 tic              Draggor, vimpulse is an emulation layer for emacs, but I did not really like it.  Buffer management behaves just slightly different, and there were other things I did not like (forgot which ones now)
2008-11-18 15:58 Draggor          tic: no reason this shouldn't work on osx, yeah?
2008-11-18 15:58 Draggor          tic: I can deal with different behaviors, so long as it all works and doesn't crash
2008-11-18 15:58 tic              Draggor, might be a problem w/ booting your Lisp. Think that's fixed now.  I have an OS X user.

2008-11-18 15:59 Draggor          I can live with ctrl-c-c and things like that, heh
2008-11-18 16:00 Draggor          Does it let me do vim tabs?
2008-11-18 16:00 tic              I can't. C-c is how I break out into normal mode.
2008-11-18 16:00 tic              Don't know

2008-11-21 23:04 bertskert        can I translate a symbol to a string in some way?
2008-11-21 23:04 bertskert        'hellothere => "hellothere"
2008-11-21 23:04 matimago         bertskert: with string or symbol-name

2008-11-21 23:05 matimago         But when you read 'hellothere with the default settings, you get an expression that, when evaluated, returns the symbol named "HELLOTHERE", not "hellothere".

2008-11-22 18:04 elderK           How did you like it?
2008-11-22 18:04 elderK           And wherefore are you?

2008-11-22 18:04 beach            I am
2008-11-22 18:05 beach            I liked it very much.  I spent the year mostly in Auckland, but occasionally went elsewhere like Wellington, Dunedin, Otago, etc.
2008-11-22 18:06 elderK           :)
2008-11-22 18:06 elderK           My family is here visiting from the United States atm.
2008-11-22 18:06 elderK           They seem mostly bored.
2008-11-22 18:06 elderK           I think they are into big city lights and whatnot more than quiet ruralish life.
2008-11-22 18:06 elderK           But hey, each to their own :)
2008-11-22 18:06 elderK           And Im glad you enjoyed your time down here.
2008-11-22 18:07 Quadrescence     I would like a quiet ruralish life. :}
2008-11-22 18:08 schme            What is stopping you?
2008-11-22 18:09 tic              Sometimes I think I'd be much happier without tehcnology, too.
2008-11-22 18:09 schme            That's crazy.
2008-11-22 18:09 tic              No stress.
2008-11-22 18:10 schme            Technology isn't stressful though.
2008-11-22 18:10 Quadrescence     I've contemplated putting my computer away and replacing it with my calculator, a pad of paper, and a pencil.
2008-11-22 18:10 tic              (only problem is that I'd probably end up building a turing machine in the end)
2008-11-22 18:10 elderK           Quadrescence, I tried that awhile ago :)
2008-11-22 18:10 elderK           Thats when I learned that I programmed more effectively, away from computers :D
2008-11-22 18:10 tic              Quadrescence, programming, at least for me, is mostly about that, actually.  Ideally, you spend more time in your head than in your editor.
2008-11-22 18:11 Quadrescence     tic: I agree.
2008-11-22 18:11 elderK           Exactly tic!

2008-11-22 18:13 elderK           It just says that it 'maps' to a list.
2008-11-22 18:13 tic              it's like map in Python.
2008-11-22 18:14 besiria          /join 
2008-11-22 18:14 elderK           Ive not used python - C-er here.
2008-11-22 18:14 tic              (mapcar (lambda (n) (* n 2)) '(1 2 3)) ;=> (2 4 6)
2008-11-22 18:14 tic              it maps a function on each successive CAR (first element) of the list.
2008-11-22 18:14 Quadrescence     elderK: pseudolisp: (mapcar sin(x) (1 2 3)) => (sin(1) sin(2) sin(3))
2008-11-22 18:15 elderK           so, basically, its C++ foreach()
2008-11-22 18:15 schme            No idea what foreach() is though.
2008-11-22 18:15 elderK           calls a function on successive elements.
2008-11-22 18:15 Quadrescence     elderK: I guess.
2008-11-22 18:15 elderK           shrug :)
2008-11-22 18:15 tic              right. the operation is generally referred to as "map" in CS.
2008-11-22 18:15 elderK           Thanks for clearing that up :)
2008-11-22 18:15 elderK           I click now :)
2008-11-22 18:15 schme            What is the return value of foreach() ?
2008-11-22 18:16 tic              depends on T, doesn't it?
2008-11-22 18:16 elderK           Aye.
2008-11-22 18:16 schme            What on earth is T ?
2008-11-22 18:16 elderK           and hey, if CAR is the first element of the list.
2008-11-22 18:16 Quadrescence     Type?
2008-11-22 18:16 tic              templates is a sorry excuse for Lisp macros.
2008-11-22 18:16 qebab            schme: the type I guess
2008-11-22 18:16 elderK           can you use map on more than the first element?
2008-11-22 18:16 schme            C++ seems very confusing.
2008-11-22 18:16 Quadrescence     elderK: It applies to all elements
2008-11-22 18:16 qebab            schme: it is very confusing :)
2008-11-22 18:17 elderK           '(1 2 3) = a list of 3 rows, each with one column.
2008-11-22 18:17 elderK           Atleast, as I see it in my brain.
2008-11-22 18:17 adeht            /join 
2008-11-22 18:17 Quadrescence     elderK: (1 2 3) ==> (1 . (2 . (3 . NIL))). mapcar applies a function to the furst element of each sublist
2008-11-22 18:17 elderK           could you not have something like,
2008-11-22 18:17 elderK           '('(1 2 3) '(2 3 1) '(3 1 2))
2008-11-22 18:17 schme            elderK: 3 rows one column?   I just see it as a list.
2008-11-22 18:18 tic              elderK, no, (list 1 2 3) is short for (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))
2008-11-22 18:18 elderK           cons means allocate a cell and cram it with 1, 2, or 3?
2008-11-22 18:18 schme            elderK: You can have '((1 2 3) (2 3 1) (3 1 2)) ?
2008-11-22 18:18 tic              elderK, '((1 2 3) (2 3 1) (3 1 2)) is a list of three lists. sure. What do you want it for?
2008-11-22 18:18 elderK           and then you terminate the list with nil ?
2008-11-22 18:18 tic              Yes.  It's called a "proper list"
2008-11-22 18:18 ia               /join 
2008-11-22 18:18 tic              but this is probably better explained in PCL.a
2008-11-22 18:19 Quadrescence     elderK: It's best not to think of "allocation" and "arrays" and such, honestly.
2008-11-22 18:19 elderK           Aye :)
2008-11-22 18:19 schme            Unless you're, of course, using arrays.

2008-11-22 18:20 schme            Hmm.. I thought it was different.
2008-11-22 18:21 schme            That sounds odd though. I know C makes me think different, so I imagined C++ would twist it somehow more :)
2008-11-22 18:22 Quadrescence     schme: Well it's definitely different than C.

2008-11-22 18:22 tic              schme, other than "oh I wish I had multimethods and gf's"?

2008-11-22 18:22 tic              schme, rethorical question. ;)
2008-11-22 18:22 schme            Oh ok.
2008-11-22 18:23 schme            I seldom miss multimethods and gf's when I poke around other languages than CL though.
2008-11-22 18:23 schme            So I dunno.
2008-11-22 18:23 schme            maybe I'll try that C++ when I get old.
2008-11-22 18:23 schme            So how about that lisp, huh?
2008-11-22 18:23 Quadrescence     nomnomnom /me eats a lisp compiler.
2008-11-22 18:23 locklace         modern c++ is about four different languages and at least two of them are much, much different from c
2008-11-22 18:23 schme            That's cool.
2008-11-22 18:24 Quadrescence     schme: It's actually not all that cool. ._.
2008-11-22 18:24 phao             schme, cool?
2008-11-22 18:24 schme            Ya I like variety.
2008-11-22 18:24 elderK           C++ is a giant toolbox of languages.
2008-11-22 18:24 elderK           you use the one that fits your needs.
2008-11-22 18:24 phao             hehe, IMO that is not acceptable for a standarized language
2008-11-22 18:24 elderK           right, locklace ?
2008-11-22 18:24 Quadrescence     C++ is a giant toolbox of messy code.
2008-11-22 18:24 phao             I mean, for any language
2008-11-22 18:24 elderK           yep, because too many people to not understand how all the tools relate :P it seems, at least.
2008-11-22 18:25 phao             elderK, C++ is just not "done" yet, they didn't get it at first
2008-11-22 18:25 phao             so they're trying to "fix" the language

2008-11-22 18:26 Quadrescence     You can't even initialize a vector with values, which they are adding into the next standard.
2008-11-22 18:26 schme            Actually I seem to see the fixering and progress everywhere.
2008-11-22 18:26 locklace         if you think c++ is a lot like c, look at (to pick one example): http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/trunk/libs/spirit/phoenix/doc/html/index.html

2008-11-22 18:26 schme            phao: ok. So take python, or haskell, or whatnot.
2008-11-22 18:27 tic              Python added "with" in 2.5.  You don't have to wait for a new release of Lisp to do that.

2008-11-22 18:27 elderK           is 'collecting' a keyword to say not nil?
2008-11-22 18:27 elderK           ie:

2008-11-22 18:28 phao             there are, yes, new standards

2008-11-22 18:29 schme            So yet a lot of people use C99 things like inlining etc.
2008-11-22 18:29 phao             but that is their choise
2008-11-22 18:30 phao             choice*
2008-11-22 18:30 phao             you can write a C that "is done"
2008-11-22 18:30 schme            Well of course. It is their choice which python standard they use too.
2008-11-22 18:30 schme            or which scheme standard, or c++ standard.
2008-11-22 18:30 phao             you can't do that in C++, afaik
2008-11-22 18:30 schme            Sure you can. Just stick to whatever standard you want.
2008-11-22 18:30 schme            worst case scenario you can't find a compiler for your standard of choice, but you can write that.
2008-11-22 18:30 elderK           Hun: I think it depends highly on teh programs needs.
2008-11-22 18:31 elderK           You can easily write C89 compliant code, with zero use of extensions.
2008-11-22 18:31 Hun              of course
2008-11-22 18:31 elderK           But, if you need to do force packing and suchlike,
2008-11-22 18:31 Hun              it's just that you don't see a lot of it.
2008-11-22 18:31 elderK           then you are kind of screwed unless you are clever :P
2008-11-22 18:31 phao             schme,
2008-11-22 18:31 elderK           And like, align your members smart.
2008-11-22 18:31 elderK           And hun, aye, you are right
2008-11-22 18:31 phao             there are, almost sure, 2 c++ standards, or 1 standards and 1 revision of it
2008-11-22 18:31 schme            phao: That's great.
2008-11-22 18:31 elderK           and ,@ is cool :D
2008-11-22 18:31 phao             schme, in C
2008-11-22 18:31 schme            phao: There's atleast 6 scheme standards
2008-11-22 18:32 schme            phao: So C++ seems to be lagging behind.
2008-11-22 18:32 phao             you have the standard called c89
2008-11-22 18:32 phao             you can expect most implementations following it
2008-11-22 18:32 Hun              and it's easy with C. try finding real portable c++ (including all that template-stuff. and without using a lot of cpp to define around compiler bugs ;)
2008-11-22 18:32 Quadrescence     schme: C++ is very, very, very big.
2008-11-22 18:32 phao             you can't expect most implementation following C++ standards fully
2008-11-22 18:32 schme            phao: Sure.
2008-11-22 18:32 phao             so you may pickup c89 and pickup an implementation and write strict c89 code, theen change implementaiton
2008-11-22 18:33 phao             your code will be compatible
2008-11-22 18:33 phao             in C++ you probably can't do that.
2008-11-22 18:33 schme            phao: So take scheme. you have one standard, a few revisions.   You can't really expect any compiler to actually support the latest revision.  Seems the same to me.
2008-11-22 18:33 phao             schme, Quadrescence said it
2008-11-22 18:33 schme            So.
2008-11-22 18:33 schme            What you are saying is.
2008-11-22 18:33 elderK           Aye, C++ /is/ //really// big.
2008-11-22 18:33 phao             scheme is minimalist
2008-11-22 18:33 schme            if you write c++ following the standard, and you have a compiler supporting the standard, then it is no problem.
2008-11-22 18:33 phao             C++ is not
2008-11-22 18:33 schme            I fail to see the difference from.
2008-11-22 18:33 schme            if you write c following the standard, and you have a compiler supporting the standard, then it is no problem.
2008-11-22 18:34 phao             I'd not compare both
2008-11-22 18:34 phao             schme, there is no compiler of C++ following the standard fully
2008-11-22 18:34 schme            Well. You can't really blame C++ for that.
2008-11-22 18:34 phao             everything that makes it possible to write C++ standard code is a standard C++ implementation, there are 0 of those
2008-11-22 18:35 schme            Sure.
2008-11-22 18:35 phao             schme, I don't know if it's fare or not, but it'd blame it yes.
2008-11-22 18:35 Quadrescence     schme: Also, somewhat irrelevant, but it's said that C++ is impossible to "master". C is a small language, and can be mastered and whatnot.
2008-11-22 18:35 phao             s/fare/fair
2008-11-22 18:35 schme            and because C++ compiler implementors obviously are lazy ass people who can't get around to implementing a proper compiler that supports the official standard.. one should stop developing the language?
2008-11-22 18:35 Hun              for certain values of mastering.
2008-11-22 18:35 Quadrescence     Also, the C++ standard also has a lot of "let the compiler vendor choose this"
2008-11-22 18:35 phao             hehehe
2008-11-22 18:35 schme            Well..
2008-11-22 18:35 schme            So does the CL standard ;)
2008-11-22 18:35 mhoelzl          /part #lisp 
2008-11-22 18:36 Quadrescence     schme: I know the CL standard has them.
2008-11-22 18:36 schme            But still.
2008-11-22 18:36 phao             schme, well man
2008-11-22 18:36 phao             C++ had its creation
2008-11-22 18:36 schme            My point is that I think that languages change and develope over time is a good and normal thing.
2008-11-22 18:36 phao             long ago
2008-11-22 18:36 phao             and some implementations came up, those are still up.
2008-11-22 18:37 phao             C++ people keep adding things to the standards
2008-11-22 18:37 schme            Ok.
2008-11-22 18:37 phao             that is not something good to implementation coders
2008-11-22 18:37 Hun              show me a single one that does not.
2008-11-22 18:37 schme            I have no idea how the ratification of the standard works, but if a lot of things gets added a lot of the time.. seems good in my book.
2008-11-22 18:37 Hun              in ANY standardized language
2008-11-22 18:38 phao             Hun, not in the amount that C++ did
2008-11-22 18:38 schme            Maybe they just need to change the ratification process.
2008-11-22 18:38 Hun              that's more or less the point of abstraction. you can't include everything into the standard (though CL had a good try)
2008-11-22 18:38 phao             when C was standarized, things just got organized
2008-11-22 18:38 phao             a FEW (very few) was added
2008-11-22 18:39 phao             so for implementation coders, it was easy to make something agreeing to that.
2008-11-22 18:39 Hun              and even this is not implemented in all compilers, given 9 years
2008-11-22 18:40 blandest         /join 
2008-11-22 18:40 schme            Lazy ass people I tells ya :)
2008-11-22 18:40 Hun              if i need something besides the standard (and i need that stuff all the time), i'm very happy that my implementor helped me before i even told him about my problem
2008-11-22 18:40 Hun              by extending the compiler or including extra libs
2008-11-22 18:40 Hun              so... what was the original problem?
2008-11-22 18:40 schme            Well.
2008-11-22 18:40 phao             C++ people keep changing the language, some vendors, to fill gaps the stardard might have (or had), ship some implementation-specific features, etc
2008-11-22 18:41 schme            It seems that Quadrescence and phao think it is a problem that languages evolve.
2008-11-22 18:41 Hun              all hail DEFMACRO
2008-11-22 18:41 schme            While I think it's quite normal.
2008-11-22 18:41 phao             there are some things that "Helped" the mess around C++
2008-11-22 18:41 Quadrescence     schme: They are adding more than revising.
2008-11-22 18:41 schme            Quadrescence: ok.
2008-11-22 18:41 Quadrescence     Evolution of languages is fine, but, IMHO, C++ is not at all organized, nor is it very clean.
2008-11-22 18:41 phao             the standard, the implementation people, its way of "fixing things", etc.
2008-11-22 18:41 schme            Well I have no idea about that.
2008-11-22 18:42 stassats`        /action checks, whether he is in #lisp
2008-11-22 18:42 Hun              what's the matter with being clean? that stuff doesn't work that well outside of academia
2008-11-22 18:42 schme            I see SBCL doing a lot of things to fill the gaps in the CL standard.   Threads and the MOP I like :)
2008-11-22 18:42 phao             schme, imagine, what is better
2008-11-22 18:42 phao             getting a disease and then curing it, or not getting it at all?
2008-11-22 18:42 phao             C++ is trying to cure
2008-11-22 18:43 schme            phao: What disease?
2008-11-22 18:43 phao             it like started wrong, so it's hard to get it right now
2008-11-22 18:43 Hun              it's easy. find an omniscient being, let him predict all possible problems and spec your language not to run into any of them. implement and call it final then
2008-11-22 18:43 schme            phao: I have no idea how we got into all this.
2008-11-22 18:43 phao             schme, a very bad one :)
2008-11-22 18:43 Quadrescence     Hun: A standard should be organized and clean I think. Leave it to the implementors to make things messier.
2008-11-22 18:43 phao             schme, nor do I
2008-11-22 18:43 schme            phao: The discussion, as far as I understand, is you and Quadrescence advocating that one should design a language, implement it, and then never change anything.   While I'm for evolution over time.
2008-11-22 18:44 Quadrescence     schme: That was not what I advocated.
2008-11-22 18:44 Hun              i view standards as a way of documenting what everybody is doing (which is likely wrong, but a neat idea)
2008-11-22 18:44 schme            Now I need a laundry run.
2008-11-22 18:44 phao             nor me.
2008-11-22 18:44 schme            Quadrescence: Well it sure looked to it when I read the text scrolling by.
2008-11-22 18:44 phao             I'm just talking about why no implementation really follows C++'s standard
2008-11-22 18:44 schme            Huh.
2008-11-22 18:44 Quadrescence     Hun: I think a standard is a way to organize things so everyone is on the "same page"
2008-11-22 18:44 schme            That's not at all what I was talking about.
2008-11-22 18:44 phao             changes are good, but if you get to the point
2008-11-22 18:45 schme            I have no idea about C++.
2008-11-22 18:45 schme            now laundry :)
2008-11-22 18:45 Hun              which never works as people tend to flip pages all the time
2008-11-22 18:45 phao             that C++ got, I doubt something good is happening there.
2008-11-22 18:45 Quadrescence     Hun: I think C did quite well.
2008-11-22 18:45 Hun              because they're busy getting things done. syncing the standard takes a long long time
2008-11-22 18:45 Hun              C has pretty limited scope, so that worked quite well
2008-11-22 18:46 phao             not that it is limited, but
2008-11-22 18:46 stassats`        c is "worse is better"
2008-11-22 18:46 Hun              nice little language with ugly syntax, but easy to compil.
2008-11-22 18:46 phao             you have to write much to say just a few
2008-11-22 18:46 phao             s/say/mean
2008-11-22 18:46 Hun              don't get me started about turing. that's besides the point
2008-11-22 18:46 Quadrescence     Hun: Hahaha
2008-11-22 18:47 stassats`        but anyway, why are you guys discussing all those strange languages here?
2008-11-22 18:47 Hun              stassats`: you can implement them as macros :)
2008-11-22 18:47 Hun              having a DSL for bit-fiddling can be useful
2008-11-22 18:47 Quadrescence     stassats`: To eventually come about saying that CL is the best choice. :D
2008-11-22 18:47 Hun              it is not. not always at least ;)
2008-11-22 18:47 stassats`        Quadrescence: i knew that in advance
2008-11-22 18:47 elderK           Hey guys, out of curiosity,
2008-11-22 18:47 elderK           what kind of runtime does CL need?
2008-11-22 18:47 Hun              depends.
2008-11-22 18:48 elderK           would it be possible to build a CL program - compile it down, and have it freestanding?
2008-11-22 18:48 elderK           If so, I might start using this as one of my primary languages.
2008-11-22 18:48 elderK           :)
2008-11-22 18:48 elderK           You've sold me.
2008-11-22 18:48 elderK           :P:)

2008-11-22 18:48 Hun              about every implementation can compile stuff to a single (more or less big) binary that can be run standalone
2008-11-22 18:48 Quadrescence     Hun: There are some places where CL isn't appropriate -- like 'systems programming" or very low-level stuff. At least in my opinion.
2008-11-22 18:48 adeht            /quit Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
2008-11-22 18:49 Quadrescence     elderK: I know nothing about compiling and lisp has sold me.
2008-11-22 18:49 tic              elderK, for SBCL: http://mikael.jansson.be/journal/2008/03/freezing-lisp-in-time
2008-11-22 18:49 Hun              define very low level stuff
2008-11-22 18:49 phao             Quadrescence, don't know about CL, but I've heard of something called lisp machines, and there people wrote OSes using lisp
2008-11-22 18:49 Hun              when i have to do that, i usually write directly in assembler
2008-11-22 18:49 elderK           Memory allocations, etc.
2008-11-22 18:49 elderK           IO
2008-11-22 18:49 tic              elderK, also, SBCL always compiles down to machine code.  What you meant was probably "bundle the runtime with the Lisp image"
2008-11-22 18:49 elderK           Anything that requires OS support.
2008-11-22 18:49 phao             it seems that those "lisp machines" were pretty decent

2008-11-22 18:50 phao             Quadrescence, do you know if it's possible to write an OS in CL?
2008-11-22 18:50 elderK           CL ---> compilation ---> native assembly.
2008-11-22 18:50 Hun              why shouldn't cl be able to do that?

2008-11-22 18:52 phao             Hun, so I can write both low and high level in CL?
2008-11-22 18:53 Hun              of course.

2008-11-22 18:53 Hun              there's usually an implementation defined way for including raw assembly
2008-11-22 18:54 Quadrescence     I should try installing open genera on this system. :D

2008-11-22 18:57 elderK           Well, say... freestanding binary.
2008-11-22 18:57 elderK           you would not want /any/ runtime unless you provided it yourself.
2008-11-22 18:57 elderK           which means, youd use only the functionality of lisp that could be compiled down.
2008-11-22 18:57 tic              elderK, you need a runtime for Lisp. Memory allocation and such.
2008-11-22 18:57 elderK           why not provide the allocators yourslef, in lisp? :P
2008-11-22 18:58 tic              it is very inconvenient to rewrite libc.

2008-11-22 18:58 tic              the gain is too small.
2008-11-22 18:58 stassats`        minion: tell elderK about movitz
2008-11-22 18:58 minion           elderK: direct your attention towards movitz: Movitz is a Common Lisp implementation that targets the x86 PC architecture "on-the-metal". http://www.cliki.net/movitz
2008-11-22 18:58 elderK           I mean, if the lisp is compiled down to native code, why would you even require allocation?
2008-11-22 18:58 phao             this language is kinda surprising me :)
2008-11-22 18:58 tic              elderK, because you need to interact with the operating system.
2008-11-22 18:58 elderK           yes, the OS.
2008-11-22 18:58 elderK           unless of course, you are writing /freestanding/ code, which is meant to be completely independent of any host.
2008-11-22 18:58 tic              How do you allocate memory?
2008-11-22 18:58 tic              Yes. That is called an operating system, see Movitz.
2008-11-22 18:59 elderK           You wouldnt until your allocator was initialized and operating.
2008-11-22 18:59 elderK           Aye.
2008-11-22 18:59 tic              runtime is not equivalent to virtual machine.

2008-11-22 19:07 elderK           if that compiled code, has been written in such a way where none of the runtime itself is used.
2008-11-22 19:07 elderK           then you are freestanding.
2008-11-22 19:07 stassats`        is CPU a runtime?
2008-11-22 19:07 elderK           ie, C without using any allocation, io, unless you provide all of that yourself.

2008-11-25 12:03 verdammelt       /part #lisp "sleepy&laptop-battery-death"
2008-11-25 12:04 fusss            adding language features one by one is a bit of adhoc, imo, better to have something that's proven correct but slow. it's always possible to roll out bytecode generation, optimization and other processing phases later.
2008-11-25 12:06 fusss            from what i read, the VM is unusual in that it never operates on a byte code stream. instead, it processes methods successively, each calling the other, and each method context has its *own* traditional VM with registers, stack, two kinds of scope and other familiar stuff.
2008-11-25 12:07 fusss            i.e. you can't just type opcodes into an assembler and expect it to work :-) the entry point has to be a method call, and that only returns to another method call. VERY continuationy.
2008-11-25 12:08 fusss            being a semantics weenie, i would probably start with the operation semantics of some tractable Lisp dialect and see how i would extend that to a full CL, or a major subset (say, something like T but with N>1 namespaces)

2008-11-26 22:45 schme_           p_l: Well.. it does strike me as the wrong channel here, but also it seems a bit dead at the moment.   So first off there's the insane handling of multiple screens, and well.. I seem to be going more and more towards using apps where I indeed enjoy placing my windows, and the float layer really blows :)
2008-11-26 22:45 ahaas            If you can compare it to StumpWM, it might be on-topic.
2008-11-26 22:46 schme_           Well... seeing how I switched to it from stumpwm what can I say.  The autotiling is lovely.
2008-11-26 22:46 p_l              insane handling of multiple screens? I found that it's actually one of the rare that implement X11 multi-screen correctly (haven't yet tried StumpWM) instead of relying on X11 making it into one big framebuffer
2008-11-26 22:46 schme_           But I think I've outgrown tiled keyboard based shittery now.
2008-11-26 22:47 schme_           p_l: It seems to put one workgroup on screen #1 and another on screen #2 for me.
2008-11-26 22:48 schme_           That's the insane part.
2008-11-26 22:48 p_l              schme_: Well, I don't see anything insane in it, maybe because by X11 spec, those are separate screens anyway
2008-11-26 22:49 schme_           p_l: Well in my book it's insane. I have two screens so I can have big windows.
2008-11-26 22:49 pkhuong          p_l: fuck the spec; X11 is a tool.
2008-11-26 22:50 p_l              schme_: Well then... don't use X11? (joking) XMonad was not designed to work with the "one big framebuffer" scheme pursued by MS Windows
2008-11-26 22:50 mbac             is auto-bignumming a standard lisp thing or an implementation detail?
2008-11-26 22:50 fe[nl]ix         mbac: it's standard
2008-11-26 22:50 vixey            mbac, part of the language
2008-11-26 22:50 mbac             i've been frustrated that i could pick up brand new languages in 2008 and still have to worry about the size of my ints
2008-11-26 22:51 schme_           p_l: Yes, exactly. That's the problem. xmonad's design is flawed.   That and the annoying bit where I can turn on/off mouse follows focus without reloading.
2008-11-26 22:51 schme_           oh weare back to lisp :)
2008-11-26 22:51 mbac             so lisp's an interesting change of pace here
2008-11-26 22:51 mbac             how long has that been in place?
2008-11-26 22:51 vixey            mbac, there's no need to worry you just have to read the specifications
2008-11-26 22:51 pkhuong          mbac: around 20 years, more if you go back to the predecessors of CL
2008-11-26 22:51 fe[nl]ix         mbac: 20+ years

At first hand, something like that seems possible (and it may speed up the development process)
2008-11-27 09:44 _3b              madnificent: not sure i'd use lisp at the engine level, but that is mainly due to not wanting to write a whole engine if i can avoid it :)

2008-11-27 09:50 madnificent      ahaas: interesting
2008-11-27 09:50 madnificent      sykopomp: if there would be better libraries for game development in lisp, it could be possible
2008-11-27 09:50 _3b              /action needs to go to gdc more often... haven't gone to one in years :(
2008-11-27 09:50 ahaas            madnificent: I went to that conference, but did not see that session. However, in the next session I overheard two guys talking about it...
2008-11-27 09:50 madnificent      ahaas: so sad!
2008-11-27 09:51 madnificent      you couldn't have been closer to miss it :P
2008-11-27 09:51 ahaas            One guy was telling the other how great the presentation was, but how ridiculous it was that they are using Lisp...
2008-11-27 09:51 _3b              heh
2008-11-27 09:51 madnificent      sykopomp: my guess is that these libraries will arise.  I don't believe a language like lisp will not rise in times like these
2008-11-27 09:51 ahaas            he said, "Why would use a markup language for an object system?!"
2008-11-27 09:51 madnificent      ahaas: LoL
2008-11-27 09:51 sykopomp         hahaha what
2008-11-27 09:52 sykopomp         I mean, apart from the idea that a markup language is great as an object system...
2008-11-27 09:52 sykopomp         <_<
2008-11-27 09:52 ahaas            I didn't think it was worth saying anything.
2008-11-27 09:52 sykopomp         you did the right thing.
2008-11-27 09:52 sykopomp         madnificent: I love writing libraries. I just don't think people would like them.
2008-11-27 09:53 ahaas            I had no idea that session was going on or was about Lisp. I must've been focused on something else.
2008-11-27 09:53 sykopomp         madnificent: but there's already a library that links up with SDL, which I figure I'll look into at some point.
2008-11-27 09:54 ahaas            I wish there was something like Pygame for Lisp, but lispbuilder-sdl seems pretty good. Pygame is just an extra layer on SDL for Python, btw.
2008-11-27 09:54 sykopomp         pygame sounds familiar
2008-11-27 09:54 madnificent      another one like that:  I'm building a raytracer in lisp for a school project.  The questions I had were mind-bogging.  (as in:  but do you have objects in CL? or can you have a loop in lisp?  But it is an interpreted language...)
2008-11-27 09:54 sykopomp         I remember a lib for python that let you write a tetris clone in 10 lines.
2008-11-27 09:55 ahaas            tetris isn't a high bar
2008-11-27 09:55 sykopomp         madnificent: Gotta love that. How's your raytracer going?
2008-11-27 09:55 _3b              yeah, python seems to have some nice quick to use game libs
2008-11-27 09:55 madnificent      I whish we had rails in lisp.  That'd make my life funnier

2008-11-27 09:56 _3b              lisp seems more focused on the high end of the curve, which can be kind of annoying when you want to work on the other end :)
2008-11-27 09:56 sykopomp         clarify?
2008-11-27 09:57 _3b              lisp has lots of features that help with simplifying the super complicated, but stuff that is already simple tends to be harder than it should be
2008-11-27 09:57 madnificent      sykopomp: due to a major time-shortage (which is this fault), it will only have minor features.  On top of that, it is much slower than the Java version.  But due to some mechanical optimizations in a limited set of functions, I can reach a speed of about 70% of what they get in Java.
2008-11-27 09:57 madnificent      sykopomp: interesting
2008-11-27 09:57 _3b              madnificent: feel free to lisppaste the hotspots, at least a few of us like optimizing things :)
2008-11-27 09:58 sykopomp         _3b: strange. I've never gotten that impression. Maybe if you gave me an example I'd see that.
2008-11-27 09:59 madnificent      _3b: If I have some time for new optimizations, I will do that :D
2008-11-27 09:59 madnificent      oh no, sorry... that is not allowed by the professor
2008-11-27 09:59 sykopomp         madnificent: that sounds pretty good. I'm sure you'd get some attention if you posted the work somewhere (once you can, if you want to) and asking for comments :)
2008-11-27 09:59 _3b              sykopomp: can't think of anything at the moment
2008-11-27 10:00 sykopomp         madnificent: will you still have to keep it closed off when you're done with the assignment? Obviously, it makes no sense to get other people working on your homework.

2008-11-27 10:01 ahaas            _3b: I've been following your discussion about that. It sounds neat. I work in Flash every day.
2008-11-27 10:01 madnificent      sykopomp: no, I may do with it whatever I want then.  The code resembles spaghetti though, so I think I won't just open it with my name on it.
2008-11-27 10:01 _3b              sykopomp: yeah, gfx engines are fun :)
2008-11-27 10:01 sykopomp         one step at a time, I'd say. I'm sure something like pygame could be thrown together in a sane amount of time (specially if it piggybacks on lispbuilder-sdl or similar)
2008-11-27 10:02 madnificent      It deserves a rewrite, when time lets me do it

2008-11-27 10:02 _3b              ahaas: yeah, i should let you look at my as3 test stuff and see if you can figure out any ways to improve it
2008-11-27 10:02 TDT_             hey, I had another quick question about the use of the (concatenate) method.  I read more about this function, and it returns a sequence.  The problem I'm seeing is that if there's no fill pointer, I can't use vector-pop and push.  Is there another option for concatenate to keep an array (through make-array with a fill pointer) that will allow push/pop/etc?
2008-11-27 10:02 sykopomp         _3b: I've actually never worked with gfx stuff. My engine is strictly text-based, and does a lot of networking >_>
2008-11-27 10:02 sykopomp         and now it's going to be a bit of a bigger pain, because I'm thinking of writing a prototype system for it. Heh.
2008-11-27 10:03 _3b              sykopomp: ah, that part is probably fun too, i've tended towards the graphics side mostly
2008-11-27 10:03 sykopomp         so working with gfx seems a little appealing. It might be easier, to an extent :|
2008-11-27 10:03 ahaas            _3b: Ok. Ping me if you ever want another pair of eyes.
2008-11-27 10:03 madnificent      okay, way past bedtime and I'm having a (Java, ugh) project to defend in the morning
2008-11-27 10:03 madnificent      good luck all!
2008-11-27 10:03 madnificent      may the braces be with you

2008-11-27 10:04 sykopomp         or at least a different level of abstraction is needed. I think there's like 1 or 2 places where numbers are used.
2008-11-27 10:05 ahaas            _3b: I think my short term goal with Lisp + Flash would just be to use Lisp as a preprocessor. I'm currently using CPP and feel like I'm wasting my time.

2008-11-27 10:07 _3b              got annoyed duplicating definitions between the 2, and had started generating stuff from lua code before i decided it was getting too silly and started looking for a better solution :)

2008-11-27 10:09 ahaas            I started trying to make games in Lisp with lispbuilder-sdl, but I've been stuck on some very basic design decisions. I'm not sure of the Lispy way to do a lot of things I am accustomed to.

2008-11-27 10:11 TDT___           _3b: Well, I'm just mostly curious about how (concatenate) works.  For example say I do (make-array 5 :fill-pointer 0) and do a few vector-pushes and all that, then to do a concatenate with another vector and make it so that it has a fill-pointer so I can keep doing more vector-pushes.
2008-11-27 10:11 TDT___           and dang net again, I'm really sorry for the constant disconnects and connects.  My net here is horribly bad right now
2008-11-27 10:12 ahaas            Yeah, I haven't had much trouble with other non-game Lisp stuff, but I've been making games in Flash for almost 10 years, so it's hard to step outside what I'm used to.
2008-11-27 10:12 TDT___           I probably could wirte a macro yet, but figured if I could do a (concatenate 'some-special-vector a b) have it effectively work.

2008-11-27 11:08 _3b              stassats: that might work, so far i'd thought of %rest, &rest*, and &arest
2008-11-27 11:09 stassats         % and * aren't very mnemonic

2008-11-27 12:08 rsynnott         yep, it had no docs, hadn't changed since 2005, didn't do unicode, and doesn't support recent wxWidgets
2008-11-27 12:09 rsynnott         (which is a problem, as older versions of wxWidgets don't support MacOS Leopard, for instance)

2008-11-27 12:10 rsynnott         fortunately, wxHaskell had a much better branch of wxc (the C interface they both use to talk to wxWidgets, which is C++)
2008-11-27 12:10 schme_           oh :)

2008-11-27 20:37 matimago         fbred: I don't now if sbcl keeps track of the line numbers.
2008-11-27 20:37 matimago         fbred: but in general, in lisp it's hard to do that, because lisp sources are NOT text files.
2008-11-27 20:37 matimago         fbred: lisp sources are sexps.
2008-11-27 20:37 matimago         fbred: and sexps can be of course generated from text files, but more often, they're generated dynamically by macros.
2008-11-27 20:37 fbred            Krystof, i'm just using the sbcl shell
2008-11-27 20:38 fbred            matimago, but at least i should get the name of the parent macro or something
2008-11-27 20:38 matimago         fbred: not even, because the macro has been expanded before compiling the code.
2008-11-27 20:38 matimago         fbred: you could try to disable the compiler and run on the interpreter.  What I do is just to use clisp and avoid compiling the code I'm debugging.
2008-11-27 20:39 fbred            isn't it possible to use some kind of debugging-symbols?
2008-11-27 20:39 fbred            there is a command called "source" in sbcl, but I don't know how to compile with debugging symbols

2008-11-27 20:40 matimago         fbred: also, did you compile with (declaim (optimize (debug 3) (speed 0) (safety 3) (space 0))) ?
2008-11-27 20:40 fbred            nope
2008-11-27 20:40 Krystof          the interpreter in sbcl is noticeably worse than the compiler at helping to debug
2008-11-27 20:40 matimago         If you want to debug, it'd be nice to tell the compiler so.
2008-11-27 20:40 matimago         Ok, so no interpreter in sbcl.
2008-11-27 20:40 Krystof          however, compiling with the default compiler policy is enough to tell you which file particular functions are in
2008-11-27 20:41 Krystof          the real answer is not to use the raw sbcl shell unless you know what you're doing
2008-11-27 20:41 fbred            matimago, ah, i just put that in the top of my file? will try

2008-11-27 20:57 matimago         nibbles: but if in addition to declaring them you want to bind them to some default value, then you have to group the variables with their default values: (let ((x val1) (y val2) (z val3)) ...)

2008-11-27 21:02 Quadrescence     And I'd want to post it to get tips too.

2008-11-27 21:06 tic              Quadrescence, you need to define a setf function.
2008-11-27 21:06 _deepfire        H4ns, I mean, I'd like to know why Graham didn't do something like a declaration of Arc's obsoletion, or something along these lines.

2008-11-27 21:07 stassats         Quadrescence: it changes binding, not to what it pointing
2008-11-27 21:07 Quadrescence     stassats: And the binding is only changed within that scope, no?
2008-11-27 21:07 Quadrescence     i.e., within the function
2008-11-27 21:07 stassats         lexical binding, yes
2008-11-27 21:08 stassats         there are mutable objects, you can change them
2008-11-27 21:08 Quadrescence     (this would explain some unexpected behavior)
2008-11-27 21:08 stassats         like lists, you can change list passed to function
2008-11-27 21:09 Quadrescence     stassats: How would do the function above then (for numbers)?

2008-11-27 21:10 stassats         what tic said, you can use macro
2008-11-27 21:10 Athas            /join 
2008-11-27 21:10 stassats         or put your number inside a mutable object
2008-11-27 21:11 H4ns             or, and that is propably the best way, return the new value of the object and reassign the variable in the caller, if required
2008-11-27 21:11 Quadrescence     H4ns: That's how I've been beginning to go about things.
2008-11-27 21:11 Quadrescence     But it gets a little tedious.
2008-11-27 21:11 tic              you rarely want to setf things anyway.

2008-11-27 22:27 matimago         fluke777: LiSP is quite gentle and instructive, since it starts with a very simple interpreter, and chapter by chapter it improves it, transforms it in a compiler, etc.
2008-11-27 22:28 matimago         fluke777: what would you find a steep curve in LiSP?
2008-11-27 22:28 fluke777         matimago: Great, I have SICP and have watched the lecture, but I got an opinion, that it just scrateches the surface. I will take a look on LISP
2008-11-27 22:28 matimago         LiSP << notice the small 'i' ;-)
2008-11-27 22:28 fluke777         matimago: aha :-)
2008-11-27 22:29 fluke777         Thanks to you all and have a fine day

2008-11-27 22:32 hypno            matimago: what is the implementation language in the book? does it cover memory management (your own vm), cpu architecture, assembly construction, etc?
2008-11-27 22:32 besiria          /quit Remote closed the connection
2008-11-27 22:34 matimago         hypno: The dragon book doesn't use any implementation language. Algorithms are written in English/pseudo-code.
2008-11-27 22:34 hypno            matimago: i ment LiSP tho.
2008-11-27 22:34 matimago         LiSP uses scheme.
2008-11-27 22:35 matimago         With a little incursion in lambda-calculus to show how to denote the semantics of a language.
2008-11-27 22:35 matimago         (which it translates immediately to scheme, to get an implementation :-))
2008-11-27 22:35 schme_           hypno: The language used in LiSP is scheme. It does however implement a wide variety of lisp interpreters. No memory management, all is built "on top" of a scheme. It does cover C generating though.
2008-11-27 22:35 hypno            oh. can you really deal with pointers and low-level cpu related hackery in scheme?
2008-11-27 22:35 schme_           No pointers and low-leveling.
2008-11-27 22:35 hypno            a:((
2008-11-27 22:36 schme_           But a very nice read.
2008-11-27 22:36 schme_           There's a new better edition too.
2008-11-27 22:36 matimago         Well, low level stuff for a lisp implementation are not the same as low level stuff for a C implementation...
2008-11-27 22:36 stassats         when you translate your lisp code into some IR, you can apply to it general algorithms, right? so dragon book is still useful
2008-11-27 22:36 matimago         It deals with the important low level things, such as environments, "stack" frames, etc.
2008-11-27 22:37 schme_           http://paracamplus.com/?CGIRunMode=book&urn=Cours/LiSP/4    the new edition, much recommended.
2008-11-27 22:37 matimago         Yes, if you want to write a good lisp compiler, both books are a must (and more of course).
2008-11-27 22:37 matimago         /action had more than ten compiler books once upon a time...

2008-11-27 22:40 spiaggia         matimago: Gries?
2008-11-27 22:40 spiaggia         matimago: the white one (what's it called again)?
2008-11-27 22:40 spiaggia         matimago: writing interactive compilers and interpreters (forget the author)?
2008-11-27 22:41 spiaggia         two dragon books?
2008-11-27 22:41 schme_           Quadrescence: Well as much sense as the cover of a book normally does.
2008-11-27 22:41 spiaggia         matimago: Muchnick?

2008-11-27 22:43 fluke777         schme_ those Principes d'implementation .... is the nw edition of LiSP? I guess it is not available in english is it?
2008-11-27 22:43 schme_           fluke777: Exactly.
2008-11-27 22:43 matimago         fluke777: not yet, but there's not a lot of changes. The ToC is identical.

2008-12-03 09:39 tc-rucho1        in stumpwm prefix key is not responding, mouse on apps isn't working either, stumpwm is not freezed, it responds, I have a working swank connection, if I do (progn (sleep 5) (message "test")) then switch to X it shows the message after a couple of seconds, so it's not freezed, it's a bug, and I need a backtrace

2008-12-03 09:42 tc-rucho1        sykopomp: the problem is that I don't want to kill X and screw what I've been doing without saving, this was not supposed to happen. So I'm trying to figure out how the fuck did this happen and how to fix it, need a backtrace for sabetts, and well, I'll keep messing till I get pissed and end up killing X or solve this
2008-12-03 09:42 tc-rucho1        the first posibility more likely to happen
2008-12-03 09:42 sykopomp         X is sort of unstable. I don't like keeping anything important in X
2008-12-03 09:43 sykopomp         I keep my emacs in a screen session, and emacsclient -c to it when in X
2008-12-03 09:43 tc-rucho1        sykopomp: the thing is that this is not an X problem, I've been using this build for a year now, never had a problem using fluxbox
2008-12-03 09:43 tc-rucho1        this is either a clx bug or a stumpwm bug
2008-12-03 09:44 sykopomp         it's most likely a clx thing, in my experience
