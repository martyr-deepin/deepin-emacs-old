2008-10-31 20:02 evocallaghan     Hi
2008-10-31 20:03 evocallaghan     Is there a similar c++ chan like this ?
2008-10-31 20:03 pingwin          /join 
2008-10-31 20:03 kantor           gl, I must to put a null at the end because the most if not all string functions are guided by that null termination at the end, no ?
2008-10-31 20:04 twkm             evocallaghan: yes.  it is not hard to guess: ##c++
2008-10-31 20:04 evocallaghan     Never mind, I found it thanks
2008-10-31 20:04 evocallaghan     twkm:Yea I was typing #cpp silly me
2008-10-31 20:04 twkm             kantor: you don't put the string into p. you point p at the anonymous array in which the string resides.
2008-10-31 20:04 kantor           yes
2008-10-31 20:04 kantor           I know
2008-10-31 20:05 twkm             didn't seem that way, but okay.
2008-10-31 20:05 twkm             probably for the same reasons you don't know whether string literals are valid strings.  (no book)
2008-10-31 20:05 bertskert        What compiler do you use? Miracle C?
2008-10-31 20:06 kantor           I just asked that because I see that even if I do not put a null at the end the strlen() function for instance calculates the correct character numbers in the string

2008-10-31 20:21 starsong         Given  a  pathname  for  a  file, open() returns a file descriptor, a small, non-negative integer for use in subsequent system calls (read(2), write(2)
2008-10-31 20:21 starsong         Is it ok if i use unsigned char ?
2008-10-31 20:21 starsong         to store the value returned by open ?
2008-10-31 20:22 twkm             ribasushi: bah, i wasn't paying attention.  yes, the parent gets a SIGCHLD.  what is it you normally do when a child terminates?

2008-10-31 20:22 twkm             ribasushi: now, how do you interpret the status that wait can store?
2008-10-31 20:22 starsong         ok so i guess im safe with unsigned int ?
2008-10-31 20:23 twkm             starsong: no.
2008-10-31 20:23 twkm             starsong: in fact you may be quite unsafe with it.
2008-10-31 20:23 ribasushi        twkm: I get back a 0-255 exit code or -1 if no children on non-blocking wait
2008-10-31 20:23 starsong         i would store the FD value IF its > -1
2008-10-31 20:23 twkm             ribasushi: nope.  re-read the wait documentation.

2008-10-31 20:32 twkm             further, say you were confident that you won't open so many files that a signed char would have problems due to range.  it might be that by saving some bytes of storage that the processor would have to work harder in order to make use of the value, since it must almost always be converted to an int.
2008-10-31 20:33 twkm             byte savings might be worth cpu expense (if any), or might not, and will often vary from project to project.
2008-10-31 20:33 starsong         :)
2008-10-31 20:33 twkm             and a second open may have other issues ... consider handling O_CREAT|O_EXCL properly.

2008-10-31 20:34 starsong         twkm: just another silly question, as you probably know, im going to read from a device and i need the reads and writes to be non blocking, is this the right choice ?
2008-10-31 20:36 twkm             well, O_ASYNC,O_RDWR is flawed anyway, but O_ASYNC isn't portable so whether it would be sufficient i cannot say.
2008-10-31 20:36 starsong         ok if its not portable then that totally sucks, could you give me a hint please
2008-10-31 20:37 twkm             O_NONBLOCK is posix (so has some portability), and would result in a non-blocking fd (when applied to non-disk devices, such as i assume is the case for you).

2008-10-31 21:59 inflex           After reading the man page for mmap(), I'm unable to ascertain explicitly if mmap() allocates any/if actual system-memory for the task, eg, mmap a 100K file, does it allocate 100K and copy to memory?  My personal translation of the mmap is that it doesn't actually allocate any significant memory, other than some buffering.

2008-10-31 22:01 koollman         that's one of the primary use of mmap, of course, so it's usually implemented that way :)
2008-10-31 22:01 LeoNerd          "allocation" isn't really a defined word for what it does
2008-10-31 22:02 LeoNerd          mmap() makes a memory range available, which is backed by the file
2008-10-31 22:02 LeoNerd          How it works internally isn't your problem. You just read/write the range and hey presto it works

2008-10-31 22:19 tp76             patryk77: yes, since you assign the return value to 'argument'.  Is it a good idea to pass NULL to printf where it expects a char * pointing to a string?
2008-10-31 22:20 tp76             patryk77: likewise, is it a good idea to tell strncpy to copy data from NULL?
2008-10-31 22:21 patryk77         but shouldn't it not go into the loop if argument == NULL ?

2008-10-31 22:58 twkm             exosyst: k&r doesn't cover c99, so that wouldn't be too surprising.
2008-10-31 22:59 Dianora          2) the use of strtok
2008-10-31 22:59 Dianora          I'd use strsep if you have it
2008-10-31 23:00 exosyst          Indeed, aside from the standard, is there a better source of information on C that encompasses C99?
2008-10-31 23:01 exosyst          It's not nice to know your resources are out of date :-S

2008-11-03 17:15 spike            Chris: are you talking of unsgined char Vs char or the fact that X expects an int and I'm passing it (... what? I'm reading an arbitrary memory position so that has really no type - so I'm not giving it a float, no?)

2008-11-03 17:44 spike            so in that code I pasted earlier on , lines 28-30, I copy what I've read into buf into ret , which is a char *, and then return it. But char * ret is declared inside the function, so the variable is local as far as I can understand, how come that works? where instead if I try to do ret &buf even at compile time with -Wall I get " warning: function returns address of local variable" ?

2008-11-03 17:45 vorpal           spike: a very useful warning
2008-11-03 17:45 spike            is the memory in the first case allocated within the functiona namespace on the stack, where in the secon case in goes onto the heap ro something and I'm simply returning the value of ret, which happens to point to that location?
2008-11-03 17:46 vorpal           spike, auto variables disappear when the function returns
2008-11-03 17:46 pnbeast          /join 
2008-11-03 17:47 spike            ok, so it's not possible to allocate a variable with malloc within the function namespace and have it automatically disappear when then function returns?
2008-11-03 17:47 Chris            no
2008-11-03 17:47 spike            and what does "auto" mean? any variable you don't manually allocate memory for?
2008-11-03 17:48 Chris            there is a horrible kludge non-standard function called alloca() which does what you want, but don't use it
2008-11-03 17:48 spike            and is it correct that "auto variables" are allocated on the stack where instead manual allocation happens on the heap?
2008-11-03 17:48 Chris            no
2008-11-03 17:48 Chris            heap and stack are implementation issues
2008-11-03 17:49 Chris            C objects are either automatic, static or allocated.

2008-11-03 17:50 Chris            be sure your compiler supports them properly though. gcc is an example of one that doesn't
2008-11-03 17:50 spike            I don't need them really, just trying to undersatnd what happens when those variables are created
2008-11-03 17:51 spike            understand*
2008-11-03 17:51 spike            and why one was considered local and the other instead was allocated outside of the function namespace
2008-11-03 17:51 Chris            function namespace?

2008-11-03 17:57 SilentAssassin   hi , if i have some array   of forexample struct blabla ,   and i want to go through the array when i cast it to void* ,  how i do it?
2008-11-03 17:57 Chris            first, struct blabla isn't an array. second, why would you cast it to void *?
2008-11-03 17:57 SilentAssassin   well i'm tryin to make my own sorting routine for any type of array
2008-11-03 17:58 SilentAssassin   and array of struct blabla means      blabla m[10] forexample
2008-11-03 17:58 vorpal           SilentAssassin: qsort
2008-11-03 17:58 spike            Chris: indeed I was, thank you very much.
2008-11-03 17:58 vorpal           !man qsort
2008-11-03 17:58 candide          Includes: stdlib.h - void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size, int(*compar)(const void *, const void *)); - qsort () function sorts an array with nmemb elements of size size - http://www.iso-9899.info/man?qsort - SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899
2008-11-03 17:58 SilentAssassin   i know about it , but i want to know how it goes through the array
2008-11-03 17:58 SilentAssassin   if it knows just the width of it
2008-11-03 17:58 SilentAssassin   and number of indexes
2008-11-03 17:58 Chris            because the comparison function you write must know the actual type
2008-11-03 17:59 SilentAssassin   yes but if i would write   void *p...     and do cmp(p[1],p[2])  it would give me unknown size
2008-11-03 17:59 SilentAssassin   error
2008-11-03 17:59 Chris            yes, of course
2008-11-03 17:59 vorpal           SilentAssassin: because you've told qsort the size of the members
2008-11-03 17:59 Chris            you can't dereference a void *
2008-11-03 17:59 Chris            it has to be cast to some other pointer type before you dereference it
2008-11-03 18:00 SilentAssassin   and is it possible to make it a  unsigned char * , which would be always 1 byte and then use the width?
2008-11-03 18:00 Chris            you cast it to whatever type it is that you actually want to make comparisons for
2008-11-03 18:00 SilentAssassin   like i would do   unsigned char *x   , and then   x[index*width]
2008-11-03 18:01 vorpal           SilentAssassin: think about qsort
2008-11-03 18:01 ThinkMinus       /join 
2008-11-03 18:01 SilentAssassin   i cant use qsort
2008-11-03 18:01 vorpal           SilentAssassin: it does what you are trying to do.  understand how it does it
2008-11-03 18:01 SilentAssassin   its a school project have to do everything on my own
2008-11-03 18:02 vorpal           SilentAssassin: yes, you can still implement your own.  my poit is to understand the mechanism
2008-11-03 18:02 SilentAssassin   ill try somethin
2008-11-03 18:02 ThinkMinus       What is best sorting procedure/algorithm?
2008-11-03 18:03 Chris            depends on your requirements
2008-11-03 18:03 vorpal           ThinkMinus: it depends
2008-11-03 18:03 ThinkMinus       depends on what?
2008-11-03 18:03 Chris            many things
2008-11-03 18:03 vorpal           ThinkMinus: see Chris's comment
2008-11-03 18:04 Chris            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Comparison_with_other_sorting_algorithms
2008-11-03 18:05 Chris            for example, bubblesort might be the best option if you only need to sort a few elements and have only a small amount of space for code
2008-11-03 18:05 vorpal           Chris: kids these days...  seems they have the attention span of gnats.   and somehow books have become unfashionable
2008-11-03 18:06 Chris            well, the latter probably comes from the former
2008-11-03 18:06 velco            these days it's all "tutorials" on the internets
2008-11-03 18:06 Chris            everything is one click or one question away on the internet, so no time for attention/books.
2008-11-03 18:06 vorpal           Chris: in the past week i've heard several people on freenode claim that books are useless
2008-11-03 18:07 Chris            marvellous
2008-11-03 18:07 vorpal           Chris: one of them claimed that he knew the answer to what he was asking, but had forgotten, despite neverhaving any use for books
2008-11-03 18:08 vorpal           yes, i'm talking about cMircieu, or whatever his name is

2008-11-03 18:23 Chris            it fails for roughly the same reason void swap(int x, int y) { int t; t = x; x = y; y = t; } fails

2008-11-03 19:52 jogla            I don't understand what int (*E)(); should do
2008-11-03 19:53 tp76             Function pointer.
2008-11-03 19:53 LeoNerd          (*E)() is an integer
2008-11-03 19:53 LeoNerd          Ergo... (*E) is a function that when called, returns an integer
2008-11-03 19:53 LeoNerd          Ergo E is a pointer that points to a function that when called, returns an integer
2008-11-03 19:54 tp76             jogla: see qsort(3) for example.
2008-11-03 19:54 bulibuta         /join 
2008-11-03 19:55 LeoNerd          Though, qsort() at least also specifies the arguments to the sort function
2008-11-03 19:55 LeoNerd          int (*E)();   declares E as a pointer to a function that returns an int, but doesn't say anything about the args to the function.
2008-11-03 19:56 LeoNerd          int (*E)(void);   further specifies that this function takes no arguments.. but the former declaration doesn't say that

2008-11-03 19:57 tp76             Right, which can cause weird things to happen if you pass wrong arguments (and I think an empty parameter list is illegal in C99).
2008-11-03 19:59 LeoNerd          Really? You sure on that? That would make large swathes of C89 code suddenly invalid
2008-11-03 19:59 jogla            hmm.. i don't seem to have qsort(3)
2008-11-03 19:59 tp76             jogla: man 3 qsort doesn't show anything?
2008-11-03 19:59 jogla            it says No manual entry for qsort in section 3
2008-11-03 19:59 tp76             LeoNerd: "I think" so no, I'm not sure ;-)  I'll see if I can find the relevant C&V.

2008-11-03 21:25 lolfrenz         it has to be big enough to store that something.
2008-11-03 21:25 spike            what's the recommended way to copy pieces of string in a larger buf? say I have char buf[32], and I want to copy 0101 from buf[3] to buf[6], snprintf? memmove?

2008-11-03 21:26 spike            char
2008-11-03 21:26 my007ms          for example i read sting and put it in buffer to change something in this string. after done i flush take new part .. etc
2008-11-03 21:26 my007ms          string/sting
2008-11-03 21:27 lolfrenz         so the buffer has to be large enough to hold the entire string
2008-11-03 21:27 twkm             spike: don't move them at all, if you can avoid it.
2008-11-03 21:27 my007ms          so if i have big buffer i will handle big part at a time and this will take time. and if have small buffer i will handle small part but fast

2008-11-03 21:31 lolfrenz         it's irrelevant if it's in one line or not.
2008-11-03 21:31 tp76             my007ms: exactly, so how long is the longest line then?

2008-11-03 21:32 tp76             lolfrenz: not if you're reading lines using fgets.  Knowing the maximum length would be a nice buffer size.

2008-11-03 21:38 bakermd          I am coming from PHP/javascript (and VB ugh)
2008-11-03 21:38 twkm             bakermd: you'll probably cut your fingers off on the corners, if you jump into a gui without first learning the fundamentals.
2008-11-03 21:38 tp76             my007ms: yes, "don't overrun them"
2008-11-03 21:39 MacGyverNL       bakermd: What twkm said. First learn the basics of the language, like, how an application runs, what a main function does, stuff like that.
2008-11-03 21:39 MacGyverNL       Then go dabble into CLI's and guis.

2008-11-03 21:51 bakermd          tp76: I have been reading K&R but have not gotten too deep yet - it helps the way I think to see a complex example and work through it line by line documenting it myself
2008-11-03 21:52 tp76             bakermd: I found reading K&R and doing all the exercises very useful.  If you want to see bigger programs, then by all means go see freshmeat.net or sourceforge.net or wherever it is you get your fix of source code from ;-)

I could do it with an array, but the problem is that the values (input) lies in the range from 0-256 and in my case I only got ~20 input values

2008-11-08 23:48 o2T7             hi, I'm trying to substitute signal() for sigaction() in my tiny application, because a global counter doesn't increment when it receives two signals that too close each other. I've included "<signal.h>", but when I try to compile "struct sigactio sa;", I get:   "error: storage size of ‘sa’ isn’t known".
2008-11-08 23:49 o2T7             counter is of type "volatile sig_atomic_t" type, btw
2008-11-08 23:49 twkm             perhaps if you type the name of the struct correctly it will work.
2008-11-08 23:50 o2T7             And I justs want to increment it reliably each time a signal is received.
2008-11-08 23:50 voidpointer      o2T7: as twkm said, is sigaction not sigactio
2008-11-08 23:50 twkm             as an aside, increment is not an operation that is required to work.
2008-11-08 23:51 twkm             only assignment.
2008-11-08 23:51 o2T7             twkm: sorry, i mistyped it here

2008-11-08 23:51 twkm             what else should i guess?
2008-11-08 23:51 twkm             i guess ... you aren't using a posix system, or you have failed to use the correct posix feature test macro.

2008-11-08 23:54 twkm             so not a posix system (merely close).
2008-11-08 23:55 o2T7             Assignment is not done, i guess that it is because of signal is being received before that the handler is reinstalled
2008-11-08 23:56 twkm             suma is incrementing the object.  but only assignment is certain to work.

2008-11-08 23:56 o2T7             both read and write are guaranteed?
2008-11-08 23:57 twkm             only assignment.
2008-11-08 23:57 velco            debian non-posix-ness does not affect sigaction
2008-11-08 23:57 o2T7             so "terminados=terminados+1" != "terminados++" in this case?
2008-11-08 23:57 twkm             velco: indeed, but the second thing does.

2008-11-08 23:59 velco            o2T7: if signals come in occasional bursts it may help to use queued signals in order not to miss one, if the rate signals come is greater than the rate you process them nothing can help you
2008-11-08 23:59 velco            o2T7: very common is to use flags like -ansi or -std=c99
2008-11-08 23:59 velco            o2T7: and wonder why POSIX funcs aren't there
2008-11-08 23:59 o2T7             I'm using -std=c99, but didn't queue anything

2008-11-09 00:22 twkm             signals are normally just bits, set or unset.  any that arrive before the signal handler begins will be treated as if just one had arrived.
2008-11-09 00:22 twkm             this is why velco mention using queued signals.

2008-11-09 00:23 o2T7             Rereading the above I see that I've not being too explicit. When I said that it was working, i was meaning that signal() was being faster or more precise or whatever. Anyway, I cant declare something like "struct sigaction sa;"
2008-11-09 00:23 twkm             i can.  perhaps lenny is broken.
2008-11-09 00:24 o2T7             I think that sigaction does the job, since it keeps the default action for a given signal, but I don't know how to make a queue of (signals?|signal handlers?)
2008-11-09 00:24 o2T7             heh, perhaps I broke it, I'll take a look ;)

2008-11-09 22:01 docmur           no

2008-11-09 22:01 prec             not 0 through 9 ... '0' does not necessarily equal 0
2008-11-09 22:01 prec             Well, do you mean 1 or '1' then?
2008-11-09 22:01 docmur           it's a char array so of course '1' or more so 49

2008-11-09 22:04 ManDay           .o-files are usually meaningless for the final object, right? they are just the object-files before the linking process and arent needed afterwards
2008-11-09 22:04 jmpnop           right
2008-11-09 22:04 ManDay           I call this a thorough success

2008-11-09 22:05 ManDay           Just in contrary .ko usually indicates a final object?
2008-11-09 22:05 jmpnop           afaik its a kernel object file

2008-11-09 22:06 twkm             on some systems .ko is to the kernel what .so is to user-land.
2008-11-09 22:06 jmpnop           i think the kernel loads object files somewhat differently as the kernel doesnt use libc
2008-11-09 22:06 jmpnop           i'd like to learn but time is against me :(

2008-11-09 22:07 madara           Yeah, I wonder how the kernel loads object files, with using libc.
2008-11-09 22:07 madara           It's pretty interesting.
2008-11-09 22:07 madara           Erm, without*
2008-11-09 22:07 jmpnop           obviously the kernel must be standalone, it runs before any thing from a disk can be loaded. So it needs to be fully self sustainable
2008-11-09 22:07 bashoh           /join 
2008-11-09 22:07 madara           Yes, that's right.
2008-11-09 22:07 jmpnop           i recon it uses its own internal version of libc
2008-11-09 22:07 init07           /join 
2008-11-09 22:08 madara           Which is?
2008-11-09 22:08 jmpnop           kernel-c? i dont know... but the memory functions can be implemented easily

2008-11-09 22:08 madara           Nod.
2008-11-09 22:09 jmpnop           so my guess is the kernel, when loading a .ko file, adjusts the GOT in there to its own replacewment functions
2008-11-09 22:09 init07           /quit Connection reset by peer
2008-11-09 22:09 madara           I suppose that would tally.
2008-11-09 22:09 jmpnop           tallyhow
2008-11-09 22:09 madara           Eh?
2008-11-09 22:09 wobster          no. on linux, the module files are un-relocated object files. not shared objects.
2008-11-09 22:10 madara           wobster: Ah.
2008-11-09 22:10 velco            I though kernel does not load modules.
2008-11-09 22:10 wobster          they need not be shared. and having that indirection causes unnecessary overhead. the kernel actually performs the relocation.
2008-11-09 22:10 velco            thought*
2008-11-09 22:10 madara           wobster: This is the same for other UNIX variants?
2008-11-09 22:10 twkm             file does not agree.
2008-11-09 22:11 wobster          I guess so. But do not nail me down to that.

2008-11-09 22:11 wobster          As for linux and freebsd, that is the way it is implemented.

2008-11-11 09:56 Zhivago          SamB: Well, a char is one kind of word, but then so is a float.
2008-11-11 09:56 SamB             anyway, you can't address bits in C
2008-11-11 09:56 Zhivago          SamB: Indeed.
2008-11-11 09:57 _Sundowner_      I claim C is about 'using' bits 'n bytes  <ducks>
2008-11-11 09:57 inflex           not that manipulating bits in C is profoundly complex, though it is at a finer resolution than the native types as such
2008-11-11 09:57 Dianora          You can get at bits using char and int plus c bit manipulation. What is so hard about that?
2008-11-11 09:57 Zhivago          Well, you manipulate bits by manipulating the various integer words.
2008-11-11 09:57 Zhivago          Dianora: So, indirectly then, via arithmetic? :)
2008-11-11 09:57 inflex            foo |= (1<<bitN); // turn on   foo &= ~(1<<bitN); // turn off
2008-11-11 09:58 Zhivago          You'd think that a language about bits would have more direct methods ...
2008-11-11 09:58 inflex           well, I suppose  foo ^= (1<<bitN); // toggle.

2008-11-11 10:18 Dr_Link          That could have been misunderstood about 3 different ways.
2008-11-11 10:18 Zhivago          Dr: If one were to look at each character in increasing order, which one would be the first that you saw?
2008-11-11 10:19 Dr_Link          Oh.  Whatever the user typed first.  In this case, the command we're looking for is simply "lol" ... so the first character should be a lowercase L.
2008-11-11 10:19 Zhivago          Dr: And which element of cmdbuff would that be?
2008-11-11 10:20 Dr_Link          cmdbuff[1], assuming that's what you're asking now.
2008-11-11 10:20 Dr_Link          It's asking to see if cmdbuff[1] == "l"
2008-11-11 10:20 Dr_Link          /action points at the if statement.
2008-11-11 10:20 Zhivago          Dr: Please increase your anti-retard medication dosage and take a remedial English class.
2008-11-11 10:20 inflex           wow, that wouldn't even compile without a blizzard of warnings/errors.
2008-11-11 10:20 Zhivago          Dr: Make sure that you actually have a C book and have read it.
2008-11-11 10:21 Zhivago          Dr: Imagining that you have read an imaginary C book will not suffice.
2008-11-11 10:21 Zhivago          Dr: Good day.
2008-11-11 10:21 Dr_Link          inflex, it compiles fine.
2008-11-11 10:21 Zhivago          Dr: Do not lie.
2008-11-11 10:21 inflex           Not a chance.
2008-11-11 10:22 inflex           eg, line 64 is wrong.
2008-11-11 10:22 Dr_Link          I get a few warnings about puts()
2008-11-11 10:22 Zhivago          I didn't think they let retarded compulsive liars on the internet anymore.
2008-11-11 10:22 Dr_Link          but it outputs a file, that's that.
2008-11-11 10:22 Zhivago          Dr: You are wrong.
2008-11-11 10:22 Dr_Link          You want proof?  You want an output file?

2008-11-11 10:23 Dr_Link          I wonder why gcc doesn't seem to care. ...
2008-11-11 10:23 Zhivago          Dr: Because you are a liar.
2008-11-11 10:24 Dr_Link          Why am I a liar?
2008-11-11 10:24 Zhivago          Dr: It is due to telling lies.
2008-11-11 10:24 Dr_Link          What lies am I telling?
2008-11-11 10:24 Dr_Link          Quote me.
2008-11-11 10:24 Zhivago          Dr: You claimed that that code compiles fine.
2008-11-11 10:25 Zhivago          Dr: That is a lie.
2008-11-11 10:25 Zhivago          Dr: Therefore you are liar.

2008-11-11 10:25 Dr_Link          Somewhat.  Though it doesn't make sense you don't seem to believe that it compiles, whereas I see kb.o sitting on my desktop right now.
2008-11-11 10:26 Zhivago          Dr: I am not interested in your delusions.

2008-11-11 10:26 Zhivago          Dr: That code cannot compile with a C compiler.
2008-11-11 10:26 Zhivago          Dr: What you are doing is insisting that "2 + 2 == 5" and saying "it worked fine this morning when I was adding apples together"
2008-11-11 10:26 Zhivago          Dr: You may choose to be a liar or completely off your head.
2008-11-11 10:27 Dr_Link          I am insisting that it generates.  I have a linked kernel on this floppy disk right now.
2008-11-11 10:27 Zhivago          Dr: You are wrong.
2008-11-11 10:27 Zhivago          Dr: Have you tried compiling the code that you pasted?
2008-11-11 10:27 Dr_Link          Yes, I have.
2008-11-11 10:28 Dr_Link          And it compiles.
2008-11-11 10:28 Zhivago          Dr: Don't lie.
2008-11-11 10:28 Dr_Link          ..
2008-11-11 10:28 Zhivago          Dr: Try it again now and paste the output.
2008-11-11 10:28 Dr_Link          Alright, if you insist.
2008-11-11 10:29 Dr_Link          apparently I am a liar.  I've been using an old kb.o file this entire time when I link the kernel files together.
2008-11-11 10:29 Samy             Dr_Link, with gcc -v output
2008-11-11 10:29 Samy             Yes. :)
2008-11-11 10:29 Zhivago          Dr: A liar and a fool. :)
2008-11-11 10:29 Dr_Link          expected expression before ] token.

2008-11-11 10:29 Dr_Link          <Zhivago> Dr: A liar and a fool. :)  <-- Not relevant to my question.
2008-11-11 10:29 Dr_Link          Anyway, continuing on with the reason I came in here.
2008-11-11 10:29 Dr_Link          (no matter how stupid I may have just made myself look.)
2008-11-11 10:29 Zhivago          Dr: Your next task is to work out what the first element of an array in C is.
2008-11-11 10:30 Zhivago          Dr: Shut up and read your book, then answer correctly.
2008-11-11 10:32 Dr_Link          It does start at 0, excuse me.  I was thinking of C++ (which does have indexes starting at 1.)
2008-11-11 10:32 Samy             Dr_Link, really...
2008-11-11 10:33 apples`          lol
2008-11-11 10:33 Dr_Link          Should I just leave now?
2008-11-11 10:33 Samy             Dr_Link, you're better off starting with another project to improve your knowledge of C.
2008-11-11 10:33 Dr_Link          I feel like I shouldn't have even bothered.
2008-11-11 10:33 phrosty          yes please
2008-11-11 10:33 Dr_Link          Great.
2008-11-11 10:33 Samy             Dr_Link, you shouldn't be dismayed by saying incorrect things :)
2008-11-11 10:33 Zhivago          Dr: You are wrong.
2008-11-11 10:33 Zhivago          Dr: C++ starts arrays at the same place as C.
2008-11-11 10:33 Samy             Dr_Link, just learn the fact that you can easily avoid being wrong.
2008-11-11 10:33 Zhivago          Dr: If you have a problem with being wrong, then please go away.
2008-11-11 10:34 Zhivago          Dr: If you have a problem with being told that you are being stupid when you are being stupid, then please go away.
2008-11-11 10:34 Dr_Link          I don't have a problem with that
2008-11-11 10:34 Zhivago          Dr: If you are capable of thinking and learning, then feel free to stay.
2008-11-11 10:34 Dr_Link          because I'll admit I  was being stupid.
2008-11-11 10:34 Zhivago          Dr: Then stop whining about it.
2008-11-11 10:34 Dr_Link          In that case.

2008-11-11 19:03 Chris            that's why there is also strncat

2008-11-11 19:03 cs32             okay, in the case of strncat, how does it determine how much space there is? is that left up to the programmer?
2008-11-11 19:03 cs32             meaning you shouldn't do it unless you're sure that there is enough space?
2008-11-11 19:03 Chris            it's left up to the programmer, hence the size parameter
2008-11-11 19:04 Chris            you shouldn't use strcat unless you're sure there's enough space. With strncat, you pass the size of the destination buffer to the function
2008-11-11 19:04 Chris            actually you'd want to pass the size of the destination buffer minus 1, to allow for the trailing '\0'
2008-11-11 19:05 zcram            you can use strcat if you've for example just computed the size of dst or you're strcatting a literal constant string
2008-11-11 19:05 cs32             zcram: dst?

2008-11-11 19:33 meeero           hm, when there's a function that expects a string, e.g. fopen - how can i operate with strings directly at the argument? for example: fopen(sprintf("/some%s", dir), "r") .... so that the function - in this case sprintf (what doesn't work of course) returns the location as a string to fopen?
2008-11-11 19:33 LeoNerd          You'll have to s(n)printf it into a buffer of your choosing, or use asprintf() then remember to free() it afterwards
2008-11-11 19:34 meeero           well, i know how to do it that way, but all that requires additional code
2008-11-11 19:34 meeero           i just thought of it might be nice to do that in the fopen-arguments
2008-11-11 19:34 wobster          too bad. wrong programming language then.
2008-11-11 19:34 LeoNerd          Using GLib as I usually do, I'd do    char *filename = g_strdup_sprintf("/some%s", dir); FILE *f = fopen(filename, "r"); free(filename);

2008-11-11 19:58 meeero           but this just makes it harder, not impossible to guess the passphrase?
2008-11-11 19:58 meeero           and what means of encryption do you mean?
2008-11-11 19:58 lolfrenz         you can't make it impossible if the password is in the application
2008-11-11 19:59 lolfrenz         security through obscurity doesn't make getting the password impossible in your case. it makes it harder.

2008-11-11 19:59 meeero           hm, well nevermind then, i'll have to take the other approach - host based auth

2008-11-12 09:11 pstickne         EBCDIC defines a-f, A-F and 0-9 "in order" as well
2008-11-12 09:12 lintrippz        what encoding is that?
2008-11-12 09:12 pstickne         so I suppose it's very safe on any actually used encoding (UTF being a superset)
2008-11-12 09:12 apples`          pstickne, could've swore C guaranteed them to be together
2008-11-12 09:13 lintrippz        it should
2008-11-12 09:13 pstickne         lintrippz:  just made it up. I think atm it should be just randomly-assigned values :-)
2008-11-12 09:13 Draconx          apples`, it does.
2008-11-12 09:13 lintrippz        ok :) pstickne
2008-11-12 09:13 pstickne         Draconx:  then it's illegal to use C with a non-ordered character set?

2008-11-12 09:29 Dianora          You have a lot of freedom if you are reading it in 8 byte chunks
2008-11-12 09:30 ltracy           Dianora, yeah, I can just put them into the ints when I read each byte.  I wasn't thinking clearly and was planning on doing something like int( *(data+4) & 0xFFFB) >> 2 ... but now I'm thinking that may cause a segfault sometimes depending on what is above the rest of the data.. of course, I guess I could just make my buffer big enough.  Thanks :)

2008-11-17 10:33 Zhivago          Spark: So what?
2008-11-17 10:33 Zhivago          Well, you're not talking about C, again.
2008-11-17 10:33 Zhivago          robot: I suggest that you use strace to determine a more interesting diagnosis.
2008-11-17 10:33 unreal           /join 
2008-11-17 10:34 Spark            yeah i guess in c this isn't a problem as you end up doing the polymorphism yourself and controlling it
2008-11-17 10:34 Spark            doing the dispatch, that is
2008-11-17 10:34 R0b0t1           Zhivago: Thanks, I'll try that.
2008-11-17 10:34 Zhivago          No, it isn't a problem in C because objects with static storage duration must have constant initializers.
2008-11-17 10:35 Zhivago          Their initialization can involve no side-effects, therefore ordering cannot be an issue.
2008-11-17 10:35 Spark            you can't do int x = f();
2008-11-17 10:35 Zhivago          Not if that x has static storage duration, no.

2008-11-17 10:39 Spark            if you keep sending stuff to the server, it will not PING you

2008-11-17 10:40 R0b0t1           Wait, wait, wait... No, that's not the problem.
2008-11-17 10:40 Spark            russell: just ask

2008-11-17 10:40 russell          Spark: I did..two times above but I got no reply
2008-11-17 10:41 russell          the fgets function returns n-1 characters from the stream, so every line in the stream is considered a character? for example "I like portishead" without the quotes is considered a character?
2008-11-17 10:41 Spark            i don't understand
2008-11-17 10:41 Spark            that is many characters
2008-11-17 10:41 R0b0t1           It's a series of characters, yes...
2008-11-17 10:41 Zhivago          russell: You appear to have suffered a failure of reasoning.

2008-11-17 10:43 Zhivago          russell: So, why do you think that a line in the stream is considered a character?
2008-11-17 10:44 Spark            simple to implement in an efficient manner, but fundamentally flawed

2008-11-17 14:56 zvrba            why are you modifying something through const pointers?
2008-11-17 14:56 Zhivago          Are you passing a const pointer to something that wants a non-const pointer?

2008-11-17 14:58 Zhivago          That isn't discarding a qualifier.
2008-11-17 14:58 Zhivago          I suggest that you re-read the documentation for that call.
2008-11-17 14:59 Shaun222         http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/column_blob.html
2008-11-17 14:59 Shaun222         const unsigned char *sqlite3_column_text(sqlite3_stmt*, int iCol);
2008-11-17 14:59 Zhivago          shaun: So, what type _does_ it return?

2008-11-17 15:00 Zhivago          shaun: So, why are you trying to convert it to something that isn't a const T *?
2008-11-17 15:00 Shaun222         ah, so ptmp needs to be const char *ptmp; rather than char *ptmp;?
2008-11-17 15:01 Zhivago          That would preserve the qualifier, yes.
2008-11-17 15:01 Shaun222         maybe i misunderstone what const did but i though it kept you from changing it?
2008-11-17 15:01 zap0             Shaun222, using hundreds of gcc warnings is a good idea (the right ones).. using -pedantic  might be too much, not many people can acheive anything useful and still be pedantic-error free.
2008-11-17 15:01 Zhivago          const is an agreement that you will not modify what it points at (in that context).
2008-11-17 15:02 Zhivago          You are breaking that agreement by pointing at it with a non-const pointer ...
2008-11-17 15:02 Zhivago          Or, more precisely, you are making that agreement void by doing so.

2008-11-17 15:20 Shaun222         quick q, i have a shared lib.c file that i'm putting all my functions in, then creating seperate programs that use them.  In my lib.c file i put the include <header> stuff for whats needed in that func.  but i'm finding if i add say openssl/bio.h to the lib.c i also need to add that to my prog.c even though prog.c doesnt use it, all code that uses openssl/bio.c is in the lib.c... is this normal?
2008-11-17 15:21 Shaun222         vorpal: i was compiling with just -W -Wall before...

2008-11-17 15:25 Zhivago          Are you doing dynamic linkage?

2008-11-17 15:26 Zhivago          Well, then at the point of compilation you are essentially determining if you should be able to do the linkage at run-time.
2008-11-17 15:27 Shaun222         i'm not sure if i should be doing dynamic... purpose was because i'm writing functions that i need to call from multiple seperate binarys i've written.
2008-11-17 15:27 Shaun222         figured it would be better than duplicating code.

2008-11-17 18:03 Draconx|Laptop   jedbrown, okay, let's simplify the example, and replace "double" with A, and "array of const double" with B.
2008-11-17 18:04 Draconx|Laptop   jedbrown, now you have a conversion of "pointer to const A" to "pointer to B".

2008-11-17 18:05 jedbrown         Yes, I'm aware of that.  But (const double[3]) is as const as possible.  There is no pointer so nothing else can be const.

2008-11-17 18:11 Zhivago          Actually, those pointer types are type compatible.
2008-11-17 18:12 jedbrown         It is given as an example in this http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf
2008-11-17 18:12 Zhivago          The requirement is that the double you want to point at is in the correct position for a double[3] array to be at
2008-11-17 18:12 jedbrown         (page 94)
2008-11-17 18:12 Zhivago          if that is satisfied (e.g., the pointer was produced by malloc), then you're fine.
2008-11-17 18:14 Zhivago          s/be at/start at/
2008-11-17 18:14 Zhivago          What might clarify things a bit is that const char x[10]; means that it is an array of ten const chars.
2008-11-17 18:14 Zhivago          There is no way to make the array object itself const.
2008-11-17 18:15 Zhivago          Which means that when you try to convert a const double * to point at the array ...
2008-11-17 18:15 icqnumber        /join 
2008-11-17 18:15 Zhivago          And I agree that this is bloody stupid;.
2008-11-17 18:15 jedbrown         Zhivago: Right, that's why I think the warning may be incorrect.  It doesn't make sense for the array to be `const' or not.
2008-11-17 18:15 floam            /join 
2008-11-17 18:15 Zhivago          It makes sense because the array _cannot_ be const.
2008-11-17 18:16 Zhivago          Essentially you are being caught in a stupidity of the C type system.
2008-11-17 18:16 Zhivago          But it is consistent with itself.
2008-11-17 18:16 Zhivago          Why do you want to do what you're doing anyhow?
2008-11-17 18:17 jedbrown         Zhivago: The optimized produces better code for indexing operations like arr[i][j] than for aflat[i*3+j].  It's also somewhat more readable with multi-dimensional arrays.
2008-11-17 18:20 jedbrown         It's just notational, but const-ness of an array is not a property which makes sense.  Const-ness of elements is the only qualifier that makes sense and this is preserved by the cast.
2008-11-17 18:21 Zhivago          constness of an array makes perfect sense.
2008-11-17 18:21 Zhivago          or, at least as much sense as constness of a struct or float or whatever.
2008-11-17 18:22 jedbrown         Zhivago: How?  It's not observable.
2008-11-17 18:22 Zhivago          Uh, in what regard is it not observable?
2008-11-17 18:22 jedbrown         A const struct means that the elements of the struct are constant.
2008-11-17 18:22 Zhivago          Let us consider memcpy(&a, &b, sizeof a)
2008-11-17 18:22 Zhivago          Um, no it means that the whole struct is constant.
2008-11-17 18:23 jedbrown         Const-ness of a *pointer* is obviously different from the target being const.
2008-11-17 18:23 Zhivago          That happens to include the elements, but that's accidental.
2008-11-17 18:23 Zhivago          What do pointers have to do with arrays?
2008-11-17 18:23 bla              /join

2008-11-17 18:33 jedbrown         Okay, but an array object is only modifiable by modifying its members.  Therefore if the members are const, it means the same thing as if the array itself could be const.
2008-11-17 18:34 jedbrown         Where `means' is in terms of what operations are valid.

2008-11-17 18:41 jedbrown         I just don't see a relevant distinction between saying that an array is const versus that it's elements are const.

2008-11-17 19:58 jedbrown         Zhivago: You're certainly correct about the qualifier on the array type (C99 section 6.7.3.8).  It's unfortunate the standard doesn't address the issue of qualified array types.
2008-11-17 19:58 jedbrown         This from 1995: http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c/browse_thread/thread/88b6e02fb2fca6d
2008-11-17 19:58 Zhivago          jedbrown: Well, it isn't like they didn't have plenty of crack handy when they designed arrays in the first place.
2008-11-17 19:58 jedbrown         This GCC bug report is also about the same issue: http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31887
2008-11-17 19:58 jedbrown         Zhivago: heh, but they are handy.
2008-11-17 19:58 Zhivago          The evaluation of an array to a pointer to its first element is completely stupid.
2008-11-17 19:59 Zhivago          There's no reason that they should be so broken.
2008-11-17 19:59 jedbrown         Certainly.
2008-11-17 20:00 Zhivago          Removing that, and supplying an implicit conversion from an array to a pointer to the type of its element would give the same effect as present, but allow arrays to be first class objects.
2008-11-17 20:00 Zhivago          Given that there is no excuse, I prefer to believe that they were stoned out of their gourds when they did that.
2008-11-17 20:01 jedbrown         Heh, thanks for the discussion.  I suppose I'll just turn off -Wcast-qual.

2008-11-18 13:34 ablmf             I am working on a project mainly handles UDP packages.

2008-11-18 13:35 zap0             unless you are going for a network speed record; there are other things you should likely concentrate on before worrying about UDP effeciency.

2008-11-18 13:37 zap0             have you profiled your app and identified UDP as the cause of your problem?

2008-11-18 13:38 ablmf            I am just doing some research.
2008-11-18 13:38 Quartus          So you have no idea if UDP efficiency is the main concern of the project.

2008-11-18 13:44 orbitz           feel free to ask questions
2008-11-18 13:44 orbitz           just don't as stupid ones
2008-11-18 13:44 lelelele         LISP has no community of oldies.
2008-11-18 13:44 lelelele         and C gotcha one!
2008-11-18 13:45 orbitz           peopel geerally prefer lisp over LISP
2008-11-18 13:45 lelelele         true
2008-11-18 13:45 orbitz           lisp has a rather strong ocmmunity, see #lisp
2008-11-18 13:45 lelelele         common lisp is in #lisp
2008-11-18 13:45 orbitz           oddly, #haskell is probably my most active channel
2008-11-18 13:45 lelelele         so that is why I am happy that C has real community of C. (not newer ones like Obje-C).
2008-11-18 13:45 orbitz           more than ##c++ or ##c
2008-11-18 13:45 orbitz           lelelele: i don't know what that means

2008-11-18 13:47 lelelele         and I do understand, cause c++ is similar syntax and backward compatability.
2008-11-18 13:47 orbitz           'lisp' is simply a family name
2008-11-18 13:47 pstickne         Obj-c is fairly old... and it is sadly under-handed against C++.

2008-11-18 13:58 Zhivago          Perl is related to satanism, and ruby is related to perl.

2008-11-18 13:59 Zhivago          Which might explain why ruby people can't figure out what 'singleton' or 'metaprogramming' actually mean.

2008-11-18 13:59 lelelele         schema is too.

2008-11-18 14:00 Zhivago          While smalltalk was initially implemented in lisp, it is not a lisp dialect.

2008-11-18 14:23 Zhivago          orbitz: you can think of a monad as telling the system how to thread some hidden state through a computation.

2008-11-18 14:27 Zhivago          Well, what a monad does is to essentially rewrite the code it affects to include the monad's state information.
2008-11-18 14:28 Zhivago          By doing this you can compose monads, and they will wire themselves into the code happily enough.

2008-11-18 14:30 Zhivago          orbitz: Well, you don't need a whole world for that, you could just have an i/o state variable, for example
2008-11-18 14:31 Zhivago          e.g., putStrLn x1, "foo" producing x2
2008-11-18 14:31 Zhivago          where x1 and x2 are output stream states.
2008-11-18 14:31 orbitz           Zhivago: Clean appears to use osemthign called unique ness types for i/o (although it provides monadic style
2008-11-18 14:31 Zhivago          orbitz: Yes, that's another alternative for sequencing. It isn't equivalent to monads, but it has overlapping functionality for describing effects.

2008-11-18 14:33 Zhivago          orbitz: The important point is that an object of a uniqueness type may have either one or zero references to it at any point in time.
2008-11-18 14:34 orbitz           Zhivago: i'm still getting used to the idea of a type system being able to 'do' things toerh than tell me if an int is an int
2008-11-18 14:34 Zhivago          orbitz: That means that 'reading' a uniqueness type is a destructive operation.
2008-11-18 14:34 Zhivago          orbitz: if I say a = b; and b is a uniqueness type, then this must destroy b.
2008-11-18 14:34 Zhivago          orbitz: Does that help?
2008-11-18 14:34 orbitz           is it still accessable via a though?
2008-11-18 14:35 orbitz           what is a now if b is destroyed?
2008-11-18 14:35 Zhivago          orbitz: A is a reference to the object that b referred to.
2008-11-18 14:35 Zhivago          orbitz: You can think of it as 'the binding moved from B to A'
2008-11-18 14:35 orbitz           ok.  so does that mean a = b; c = b; is now a compiler error?
2008-11-18 14:35 Zhivago          orbitz: Alternately, you can think of it as a = b; did a destructive copy of b to a.
2008-11-18 14:36 Zhivago          orbitz: Analogous to physically moving an object from slot b to slot a.
2008-11-18 14:36 orbitz           ok
2008-11-18 14:36 orbitz           but it hasn't been modified correct?

2008-11-18 14:37 orbitz           Zhivago: so does that mean in order to read something, we can just keep on doing destructive copies of the stream?

2008-11-18 14:38 Zhivago          orbitz: There is no state change per-se, but since we shoot anyone who tries to re-use b, we are allowed to re-use the object that b referred to safely ... :)
2008-11-18 14:39 orbitz           hrm
2008-11-18 14:39 orbitz           Zhivago: do you have a concrete example I could see to help drive it home?
2008-11-18 14:39 Zhivago          orbitz: It's a bit like this. We get a package, and we know that no-one is ever going to ask to use that package ever again.
2008-11-18 14:40 Zhivago          orbitz: So, being lazy bastards, we can tear it apart to make a new widget to give to the next customer.
2008-11-18 14:40 Zhivago          orbitz: hmm, imagine you get a broken widget returned -- and you know that no-one is allowed to ask for it back. You can now fix it, and give it to someone else without getting into trouble.
2008-11-18 14:40 Zhivago          or you could just throw it away and make a new widget
2008-11-18 14:41 Zhivago          the result would be equivalent.
2008-11-18 14:41 orbitz           ok
2008-11-18 14:41 orbitz           so the difference here is that, in a monad we basically have syntatic sugar to pass around a state variable.  in uniqueness typing he type system is allowing you to destructively 'reuse' teh stream in a way that nobody else can use it?

2008-11-18 14:47 orbitz           libc is part of C
2008-11-18 14:47 phao             so yes?
2008-11-18 14:47 Zhivago          orbitz: It's all about the balance between time and space -- if you have time, you may need to make space -- if you have space you may need to make time.

2008-11-18 14:48 orbitz           Zhivago: it seem slike in haskell, in order to solve some problems sanely, you need teh lazyness, but lazyness seems to have its own slew of problems, is this the case or just my naivette? could there be a strict pure functional language that isn't painful to write it?
2008-11-18 14:48 orbitz           (are there any strict pure functional languages?)
2008-11-18 14:49 zap0             how are these 'most people'?    who is "they" ?
2008-11-18 14:49 Zhivago          orbitz: I think that's accurate.

2008-11-18 14:49 Zhivago          orbitz: On the other hand, without laziness, you get a whole slew of problems, too.
2008-11-18 14:49 phao             zap0, people on the web (wikipedia, forums), books I read, like K&R
2008-11-18 14:50 Zhivago          orbitz: You can think of laziness as automatically turning your computation into a pipeline.
2008-11-18 14:50 orbitz           Zhivago: it seems like a number of problems would just be difficult to solve without lazyness in a pure functional language

2008-11-18 14:54 phao             that is being able to implement a C-implementation on that plataform?
2008-11-18 14:54 Zhivago          phao: Let's imagine that your boss has just taken a big hit of crack and decided that you should make your program run on a XsdkjhfSkjh243 processor.

2008-11-18 14:55 Zhivago          phao: On the other hand, there is probably a C compiler that targets that platform included in the development kit.
2008-11-18 14:55 orbitz           Zhivago: Clean looks interesting.  first time i've come across uniqueness typing
2008-11-18 14:56 Zhivago          orbitz: I think that uniqueness typing is a relatively recent clarification of linear typing.

2008-11-18 14:57 Zhivago          C doesn't do anything particularly interesting or complicated.

2008-11-18 15:02 Chris            And abstract off implementation defined behaviour.
2008-11-18 15:02 Chris            So that it's easily... portable..
2008-11-18 15:02 phao             s/some times/always
2008-11-18 15:02 Zhivago          If you write portable code in C, then it will be portable. :)
2008-11-18 15:02 Zhivago          If you do not write portable code in C, then it won't be.
2008-11-18 15:02 Zhivago          C makes it very, very, very easy not to write portable code.
2008-11-18 15:02 phao             Zhivago, ok, but, can you tell me if what I said is right?

2008-11-18 15:03 phao             [05:02] <phao> Zhivago, not making complex things makes C not requiring any complex feature from a given plataform, that makes it easy to port C to that plataform, is that right?

2008-11-18 16:09 Zhivago          Wordnet tells me what people think a word should mean, if they've bothered to make entries for it.
2008-11-18 16:09 Zhivago          It doesn't tell me how people actually use a word.
2008-11-18 16:10 xsdg             zap0: as an actual use-case, I was working on a project where we managed to determine programmatically that "4 dogs and 3 cats" and "2 dogs, 1 cat, and 4 other animals" could both be referring to the same group of things
2008-11-18 16:10 zap0             i use it just to id a word as verb,noun,adj..    thats about how far i got with any of my sentence deconstruction work..   instead i went back to image recognition.. it was more fun!.
2008-11-18 16:11 xsdg             zap0: and in that case, wordnet's "this word is a more general form of that word" relationships really came in handy
2008-11-18 16:12 xsdg             aah, yeah, the hypo/hypernym relationships

2008-11-21 21:44 dav7             hi. I want to read from standard input without using a fixed array. is it possible to treat stdin as a file, block until I recieve EOF, calculate the size, malloc enough memory, read stdin in all at once, etc, or is there a similar way?
2008-11-21 21:44 dav7             I mainly just want my program to not use a lot of RAM, that's all.

2008-11-21 21:45 WiGGi            dav7, so what makes you think you can't do that with the standard library?

2008-11-21 21:46 WiGGi            stdin is a FILE*, so yea,but I doubt you'll ever receive EOF on it
2008-11-21 21:46 dav7             oh.
2008-11-21 21:46 Dianora          heh
2008-11-21 21:46 dav7             WiGGi: but what about CTRL+D?
2008-11-21 21:47 WiGGi            IDK what that does
2008-11-21 21:47 dav7             ^D == EOF, or I need to go back to UNIX school

2008-11-21 21:47 dav7             yes

2008-11-21 21:47 Dianora          dav7: Do you have a good set of man pages?
2008-11-21 21:47 WiGGi            sounds weird
2008-11-21 21:47 dav7             WiGGi: stdin is a stream, which is why EOF was invented
2008-11-21 21:47 dav7             WiGGi: to put "stops" in teh infinity :P

2008-11-21 21:47 WiGGi            Well, don't ask me, I use Windows, there's no EOF on stdin there that I know of.

2008-11-21 21:51 dav7             Dianora: my first idea was to getc() all the chars, wait for EOF, malloc, ungetc() them all back to the beginning and fgetc() them all, but I think that's not such a wise move.
2008-11-21 21:51 WiGGi            read like you would with any file...
2008-11-21 21:52 Dianora          dav7: man fseek

2008-11-21 21:53 dav7             WiGGi: why?
2008-11-21 21:53 Dianora          WiGGi: I wouldn't know. I'm a fbsd user.
2008-11-21 21:53 Dianora          OSS is better.
2008-11-21 21:53 backslash7       If I use    unsigned char foo = 50; foo &= 0xC0;    is the decimal value 50 of foo automagiclly converted into hex or does it have to be in hex already then?
2008-11-21 21:53 WiGGi            cause oss is protable
2008-11-21 21:53 Dianora          but that is way off topic for this channel
2008-11-21 21:53 dav7             WiGGi: oh.
2008-11-21 21:53 WiGGi            and documented at least

2008-11-21 21:53 Dianora          alsa is the wrong solution for the wrong problem.

2008-11-21 21:54 dav7             it works
2008-11-21 21:54 WiGGi            pretty much all unixes provide an oss-compatible interface

2008-11-21 21:54 WiGGi            doesn't matter
2008-11-21 21:54 Dianora          backslash7: as far as the computer is concerned it is just a series of bits
2008-11-21 21:54 WiGGi            to the computer it's still 8 bits.
2008-11-21 21:54 dav7             WiGGi: eh? then how does the sound get out?
2008-11-21 21:54 dav7             heh
2008-11-21 21:54 onur             Dianora: I want to read a file to buffer for use it like a format in printf
2008-11-21 21:54 Dianora          backslash7: it's a bit pattern representing 50 in decimal fitting into an unsigned char
2008-11-21 21:54 WiGGi            dav7, it's own drivers
2008-11-21 21:54 dav7             mmm
2008-11-21 21:54 WiGGi            dav7, yup, /dev/dsp

2008-11-21 21:55 backslash7       Dianora, So it should work with the bitwise operator right? No matter if its and int or a char
2008-11-21 21:55 dav7             WiGGi: well arch linux randomly decided to use OSS on my older P3 with an SB16, and ALSA on my newer box with integrated intel audio.
2008-11-21 21:55 dav7             WiGGi: =P
2008-11-21 21:55 Dianora          I looked at alsa

2008-11-21 21:55 Dianora          badly documented
2008-11-21 21:55 Dianora          horrible
2008-11-21 21:55 Dianora          nothing in it can't be done by oss
2008-11-21 21:55 WiGGi            actually, mostly undocumented
2008-11-21 21:56 Dianora          WiGGi: I noticed.
2008-11-21 21:56 Dianora          and it is "solving" nothing
2008-11-21 21:56 dav7             something I have noticed is that alsa has a proprietary driver written by creative for their x-fi something something
2008-11-21 21:56 Dianora          once you have kqueue, you don't need that event crap in alsa
2008-11-21 21:56 WiGGi            instead of rewriting oss at the core, some idiots decided they needed a completely new compelx and undocumented and huge api
2008-11-21 21:56 dav7             everyone's all like "!!!!!! >.< meep" when they see the purported lack of quality of said driver
2008-11-21 21:56 Dianora          backslash7: you got it clear now?
2008-11-21 21:56 dav7             then, you have to get 10 posts down in the forum for someone to mention that OSS works
2008-11-21 21:56 dav7             yet they seem to say it reluctantly
2008-11-21 21:56 Dianora          dav7: FreeBSD 7 ftw ;-)

2008-11-21 21:58 WiGGi            most notably, fbsd has it's sound system in the kernel
2008-11-21 21:58 dav7             Dianora: question: my friend finds that when he tries to remove programs the package manager executes the equivalent of "uhh, there was a problem removing your package, but I'll forget about its metadata anyway" - what should he do?

2008-11-21 21:58 WiGGi            dav7, you need to shut down alsa

2008-11-21 21:58 Dianora          backslash7: eh look what is 0xC40 does that fit into a byte?

2008-11-21 22:03 Dianora          backslash7: ok please work out what 50 is as a bit pattern. How would you do that? tell us.
2008-11-21 22:03 Dianora          ahhhh no
2008-11-21 22:03 backslash7       So it should be 10000000

2008-11-21 22:04 Dianora          go away work it out

2008-11-21 22:05 Dianora          0x32 is hex, now backslash7 has to write that out as binary

2008-11-21 22:21 Dianora          you can't know the size of a stream a priori
2008-11-21 22:21 dav7             I have no idea how else to malloc()

2008-11-21 22:22 dav7             what about like
2008-11-21 22:22 Dianora          dav7: the usual way is to read a line at a time

2008-11-21 22:23 Dianora          read it in using fgets() parse it up
2008-11-21 22:23 dav7             allocate one byte, read to it, malloc new pointer of size (oldptrlen+1), strcpy oldptr to newptr, free oldptr
2008-11-21 22:24 Dianora          no dav7
2008-11-21 22:24 Dianora          that's mental

2008-11-21 22:24 dav7             xD
2008-11-21 22:24 Dianora          you could malloc 256 bytes, realloc as you read more of the line
2008-11-21 22:24 dav7             realloc()?!
2008-11-21 22:24 Pryon            you've already wasted more time that you will ever save by this "optimization" you're doing
2008-11-21 22:25 Dianora          what Pyron said

2008-11-21 23:41 Gorbulas         the >>8 shifts the bits 8 to the right. it's the same as dividing by 2^8
2008-11-21 23:41 _Nike_           yes, now working

2008-11-21 23:42 _Nike_           I making one protect, and encript whe winsock send / recv

2008-11-21 23:42 _Nike_           why can't I edit with "buf[0] = 0x64" ???
2008-11-21 23:42 _Nike_           =\
2008-11-21 23:42 voidpointer      _Nike_: but if key is a constant, why do you just use a value instead, key >> 8?
2008-11-21 23:42 gl               :(
2008-11-21 23:42 _Nike_           hum
2008-11-21 23:42 _Nike_           I'll verify
2008-11-21 23:43 _Nike_           I'll remove this
2008-11-21 23:43 Gorbulas         straight xor encryption is easily broken so you might want to do more if security is a real issue
2008-11-21 23:43 _Nike_           yah
2008-11-21 23:43 _Nike_           I tried triple des

2008-11-21 23:45 Gorbulas         that should work if buf is a pointer to at least one character value
2008-11-21 23:45 voidpointer      _Nike_: if buf[0] is a lvalue modificable, yes
2008-11-21 23:45 _Nike_           how I can see this ?

2008-11-22 19:58 roothorick       or am I misreading too?

2008-11-22 19:59 twkm             struct X ** would be fine.  X ** is not since there is no typedef for X.

2008-11-22 20:55 twkm             the main problems are: you don't check scanf's return value, scanf isn't being limited so can overflow the buffer, the quotes around stringa[i] are incorrect, and you should print a newline before exiting.

2008-11-22 22:04 gilles           could anyone explain me why this http://pastebin.com/d3839b04d doesn't compile : "conflicting types for read_field'

2008-11-22 22:06 sqweek           gilles: when you do that it creates an "implicit" type of the function - basically the compiler assumes everything is an int
2008-11-22 22:06 gilles           first time i've been coding C... i understand the concepts but i'm so used to high level tools that i do silly things every line :-(

2008-11-22 22:07 sqweek           so it has an implicit definition of like "int read_field(int start, int length)" which later conflicts with your actual definition
2008-11-22 22:07 sqweek           you can either move the function or add a function prototype before you use it

2008-11-24 10:15 pcc              sweetgum, you must put the definition in a single .c file and an extern declaration in the header file.

2008-11-24 10:15 freakabcd        wcstok, is it possible to further the conversation in that respect? I'm still a bit confused. The project is a huge C only project (mplayer) and my file unfortunately has to use a lib which is C++ :(
2008-11-24 10:17 wcstok           freakabcd: 1) compile the main function as part of your c++ module...rename the current one and call it, 2) build the thing as normal, when it comes to the linking step you'll need to use g++ 3) don't do this, it's a bad idea
2008-11-24 10:17 freakabcd        I know it is a shitty idea. but its very unfortunate
2008-11-24 10:18 Draconx|Laptop   /join 
2008-11-24 10:18 freakabcd        I can do this in a hackish way now. build mplayer manually. when it fails on my vo_device, I use g++ on that file. then resume build.
2008-11-24 10:18 freakabcd        linking with gcc works fine
2008-11-24 10:18 wcstok           then you aren't using anything from the c++ lib, so why are you bothering with this
2008-11-24 10:19 freakabcd        but the file has sail::blah and all that crap

2008-11-24 10:23 wcstok           you may as well include a perl file in your c source and ask the same question
2008-11-24 10:23 JakobS           i just wrote a little c app. i'm no c programmer... just for comparision with the same in bash. i expected the c one to be much faster... it is not. all it does is executing some apps. in bash its: ./a ...  ./k . in c i did system("./a") ... system("./k") . any idea why the bash one runs in double speed??
2008-11-24 10:23 freakabcd        umm.. thats exactly what i am doing. when build stops i use g++ to build that file.
2008-11-24 10:24 freakabcd        wcstok, maye this issue is a makefile/autofoo issue rather than the more complicated interlanguage iussue
2008-11-24 10:25 wcstok           jakobs: well for starters, every time you run system, you're starting up a new shell
2008-11-24 10:25 JakobS           wcstok: well... thank you! how could i avoid this?
2008-11-24 10:25 wcstok           dont call system?
2008-11-24 10:26 freakabcd        JakobS, you may try doing it the same way bash does it: fork then exec
2008-11-24 10:26 JakobS           wcstok: so how do i run an executable?
2008-11-24 10:26 keatoNpz         wcstok, fix me next!
2008-11-24 10:26 freakabcd        keatoNpz, lol. what is wrong?
2008-11-24 10:27 wcstok           what freakabcd said
2008-11-24 10:27 keatoNpz         Well
2008-11-24 10:27 freakabcd        JakobS, read up on fork() and the exec..() calls
2008-11-24 10:27 wcstok           though really if all you're doing is running a few program in sequence...this is what bash (and other shells) were made for
2008-11-24 10:27 keatoNpz         Im writting a code to make a postal label
2008-11-24 10:27 JakobS           freakabcd: thanks!

2008-11-24 10:28 freakabcd        lol
2008-11-24 10:28 keatoNpz         Anyways, it runs but when i try to input something
2008-11-24 10:28 wcstok           how about you put that on a proper paste site and ask a specific question about a specific issue
2008-11-24 10:28 keatoNpz         I get
2008-11-24 10:29 keatoNpz         Well wcstok, i've had the issue semi-addressed, and i will put it on a differnet paste site sorry
2008-11-24 10:29 keatoNpz         But
2008-11-24 10:29 keatoNpz         Visual studios gives me
2008-11-24 10:29 keatoNpz         "just in time debugger"

2008-11-24 10:30 keatoNpz         say a name/address/lastname
2008-11-24 10:30 JakobS           guys, do you think i will run in less time in bash? if i got you right, it won't... maybe the startup time bash needs will be shorter. am i right?
2008-11-24 10:31 keatoNpz         I would be beyond grateful if someone could fix my problem
2008-11-24 10:31 keatoNpz         Im pretty sure its simple
2008-11-24 10:31 keatoNpz         and i cant use structures
2008-11-24 10:32 keatoNpz         becuse my prof likes to make things difficult
2008-11-24 10:32 wcstok           jakobs: if it runs faster, which it might, it won't be by much...and you're going to put more effort into it than it's worth
2008-11-24 10:33 JakobS           wcstok: so you think it doesnt make any sense? i thought about an static init
2008-11-24 10:34 freakabcd        JakobS, wcstok is right. if all you are going to be doing is executing programs/scripts in sequence, running them from a bash script is itself the way to go
2008-11-24 10:34 Budd             /join 
2008-11-24 10:34 electricfeel     why would anyone use... while (*dst++ = *src++); in practice to copy a string? since the dst pointer will not be aligned correctly... (unless you wanted to keep track of how many characters there were and re-align it)
2008-11-24 10:34 wcstok           electricfeel: what exactly does that have to do with alignment?
2008-11-24 10:35 electricfeel     wcstok: because the destination would be at the end of the string
2008-11-24 10:35 wcstok           er...so?
2008-11-24 10:35 electricfeel     well, how would you get it back to the beginning of the string?
2008-11-24 10:36 wcstok           save a copy?
2008-11-24 10:36 electricfeel     guess so
2008-11-24 10:36 JakobS           thank you very much!

2008-11-25 12:09 Dianora          nDuff: Shiba just admitted to reverse engineering some commercial software.

2008-11-25 12:10 nDuff            Shiba, the question is if you're talking morally or legally, and in the latter case in which jurisdiction...
2008-11-25 12:10 Dianora          I think it's a silly stupid law
2008-11-25 12:10 Madsy            Digital Millenium Copyright Act is one of the stupidest thing ever put into law. Except for the latest EU property rights directive.

2008-11-25 12:12 dav7             kopf: it doesn't read 2 in at a time. it reads one in, then "saves" the last char

2008-11-27 10:31 orflon           hello, say that: a = 10011011; a << 2; then a is 1101100 right? and if I do: a>>2, after that I should get 0011011 (so the first 1 in the initial "a" is lost?)
2008-11-27 10:32 wcstok           compengi: if you're talking about passing float vs double params to printf, through the variable argument list, the float gets promoted to double when you pass it --- so yes, you use %f to print both
2008-11-27 10:32 twkm             typedef doesn't have "arguments", it converts a declaration into a type alias, that's all.  the idenfitier is then a typename instead of an object or function name.
2008-11-27 10:32 dbtid            compengi: no way to print a float; it gets converted to a double when you call printf, so there's only doubles in printf

2008-11-27 10:38 twkm             orflon: perhaps, again it depends on whether that leading 1 was the sign bit.  if a is unsigned and that leading 1 is the msb, then you don't get it back.

2008-11-27 11:05 Zhivago          It doesn't depend on signage at all.
2008-11-27 11:05 kessel           orflon: and, say you do #define MSK_BITMSK(n)  ((1u << n)-1)     a &= MSK_BITMSK(6);  and a decent compiler will make this a simple a &= 0x3f;

2008-11-27 11:06 Zhivago          Uh, no.
2008-11-27 11:06 xscottx3         hi all
2008-11-27 11:06 Zhivago          I suggest that you test your theory and then explain why it is wrong.
2008-11-27 11:07 orflon           ok so if I have to store the last x bits of a number I can do:  & operation with x ones?
2008-11-27 11:07 Zhivago          orflon: I suggest that you adopt the terms 'least significant bits' and 'most significant bits' rather than 'last bits'
2008-11-27 11:07 kessel           orflon: yes, that's the theory of bitwise and
2008-11-27 11:07 orflon           ok ok
2008-11-27 11:08 pngwen           /join 
2008-11-27 11:08 orflon           'least significant bits' are the 'last bits' right?
2008-11-27 11:08 jsbach           if i have 1000000 signed then i have -128 and if i subtract one, i have -129 rite?
2008-11-27 11:08 pngwen           orflon: least significant bits are the bits with the lowest value.
2008-11-27 11:08 Zhivago          orflon: God only knows what the hell you mean by 'last bits'
2008-11-27 11:09 Zhivago          oflon: The least significant bits contribute the least value to the integer result.
2008-11-27 11:09 pngwen           orflon: their position in the bitstream depends on endianness of your system.
2008-11-27 11:09 Zhivago          No, they don't
2008-11-27 11:09 Zhivago          There is no bitstream, and it doesn't depend on endianness.
2008-11-27 11:09 Zhivago          C's bitwise operations are actually integer operations and they operate on integer numbers.
2008-11-27 11:09 orflon           Zhivago, 0000001, 1 is the last bit in my orology.
2008-11-27 11:09 Zhivago          Using integer values to represent bit vectors.
2008-11-27 11:10 Zhivago          orflon: And what does 0000001 mean as an integer value?
2008-11-27 11:10 orflon           just 1 in decimal.
2008-11-27 11:10 orflon           ah 1

2008-11-27 11:10 Zhivago          orflon: Then that would be the least significant bit.
2008-11-27 11:10 orflon           ok and to make sure: in this 100000, 1 is the most significant?
2008-11-27 11:11 pngwen           yes, that is correct
2008-11-27 11:11 orflon           ok.
2008-11-27 11:11 orflon           thanks.
2008-11-27 11:11 kessel           and in short LSB and MSB
2008-11-27 11:11 Zhivago          orflon: Probably not.
2008-11-27 11:12 orflon           Zhivago, what do you mean?
2008-11-27 11:12 Zhivago          orflon: It depends on how many bits are present that you haven't written. If your have four bits, then 1000 has only the most significant bit set, 0100 has the second most significant bit set, and so on.
2008-11-27 11:13 pngwen           Zhivago: in what he typed, the 1 was the most significant.
2008-11-27 11:13 Zhivago          Well, you're unlikely to have a 6 bit vector, so that's probably 00100000, in which case that's the 3rd most significant bit.
2008-11-27 11:13 orflon           so it's a matter of typing? but the values are the same.
2008-11-27 11:14 pngwen           it's a matter of how many bits you have.  Left most, is generally most significant
2008-11-27 11:14 Zhivago          orflon: Leading zeros are significant to 'most significant bits'
2008-11-27 11:14 pngwen           so if you have an 8 bit byte, then what Zhivago said is true.
2008-11-27 11:14 orflon           shouldn't they be eliminated? this is more confusing I think.
2008-11-27 11:14 Zhivago          They should only be eliminated if you can't grasp what 'most significant bit' means.
2008-11-27 11:14 kessel           well, consider a 10bit or 12bit DAC/ADC
2008-11-27 11:15 jsbach           is there a way to dereference a certain length of an array to hex in printf?
2008-11-27 11:15 pngwen           the computer doesn't eliminate leading zeros, they are always there
2008-11-27 11:15 Zhivago          jsbach: With the amazing power of iteration.
2008-11-27 11:15 jsbach           i can do %.*s, but not %.*x
2008-11-27 11:15 orflon           ok
2008-11-27 11:15 Zhivago          You can ignore leading zeroes if you're talking about 'least significant bit', because they're irrelevant to it.
2008-11-27 11:15 jsbach           really amazing
2008-11-27 11:16 Zhivago          jsbach: Say that N times.

2008-11-27 11:35 orflon           Zhivago, can you make me some questions on pointers because I don't think i've understood them. For example I thought that: char *a; a points at one char, but this is no correct, I still dont understand why.
2008-11-27 11:35 orflon           s/no/not.
2008-11-27 11:35 Zhivago          orlon: That is correct.
2008-11-27 11:36 Zhivago          orlon: char a = 'x'; char *b = &a; <- b points at one char.
2008-11-27 11:36 Zhivago          orflon: The confusion is probably because C's memory is in terms of 'vectors of objects'.
2008-11-27 11:36 orflon           mm someone told me that it could point to lots of chars/ints or whatever.
2008-11-27 11:36 Zhivago          orflon: a in this case is one char. C considers this memory to be a vector of char of length 1.
2008-11-27 11:37 Zhivago          orflon: They are confused -- the pointer points at one object in a vector of objects.
2008-11-27 11:37 orflon           yes!
2008-11-27 11:37 Zhivago          orflon: In the case above, b points at one char in a vector of one char.
2008-11-27 11:37 Breefield        I'm trying to dev Cocoa apps for mac, I figured out C, and wrote some simple stuff just to make sure I had syntax down. But I'm trying to move on to Objective-C is there another room for that, or is here fine?
2008-11-27 11:37 Zhivago          orflon: char d[6] = "hello"; char *e = &d[0];
2008-11-27 11:37 Zhivago          orflon: e points at one char in a vector of 6 chars.
2008-11-27 11:37 Zhivago          orflon: e+1 points at the next object in the vector.
2008-11-27 11:37 orflon           that's why: char *a; gets(a) causes segfault right?
2008-11-27 11:38 Zhivago          orflon: What value are you passing to gets there?
2008-11-27 11:38 orflon           lots of chars.
2008-11-27 11:38 Zhivago          orflon: No, you're passing an undefined value to gets.
2008-11-27 11:38 orflon           because we haven't allocated space.
2008-11-27 11:38 orflon           what do you mean?
2008-11-27 11:38 pngwen           Breefield: yeah, check out #objc
2008-11-27 11:38 orflon           why is it undefined?
2008-11-27 11:38 Zhivago          orflon: Gets expects the pointer you give it to be pointing into a vector of char with enough space following that to write the line it reads into.
2008-11-27 11:38 Breefield        thanks!
2008-11-27 11:38 Zhivago          orflon: Because you didn't assign a value to a.
2008-11-27 11:39 pngwen           Breefield: np!
2008-11-27 11:39 Zhivago          orflon: char b[512]; char *a = &b[2]; gets(a);
2008-11-27 11:39 orflon           is this valid?
2008-11-27 11:39 Zhivago          orflon: You pass gets a pointer to the 3rd char in a vector of 512 chars.
2008-11-27 11:39 orflon           yes yes

2008-11-27 11:40 Zhivago          orflon: Does that make sense?

2008-11-27 11:50 orflon           8-bit binary byte, better.
2008-11-27 11:50 dbtid            mask off the lower 4 bits
2008-11-27 11:50 orflon           4?

2008-11-27 11:59 dbtid            masking bits off?  yes.
2008-11-27 11:59 orflon           I mean these values
2008-11-27 11:59 dbtid            keeping bits unchanged?  yes.
2008-11-27 11:59 Zhivago          orflon: C doesn't have literals for base two, so it's normally done with hex.
2008-11-27 12:00 dbtid            depends on what you want.  but you use & to turn bits off in the result, if you need to, and you can use | to turn bits on in the result.
2008-11-27 12:00 orflon           it's strange, I suppose you knew beforehand that 0xf0 is 11110000.
2008-11-27 12:00 dbtid            if x is a bit, then x | 1 == 1.
2008-11-27 12:00 dbtid            if x is a bit, then x | 0 == x.
2008-11-27 12:00 dbtid            then you can build sets of bits, in hex, with constants.
2008-11-27 12:01 orflon           mm
2008-11-27 12:01 dbtid            so if you want to make sure that the upper 8 bits of a 32 bit quantity are set, you could do
2008-11-27 12:01 dbtid            u | 0xFF000000
2008-11-27 12:01 orflon           I think it's more confusing when this guy used in[1] & 0xf0, instead of in[1] & 11110000
2008-11-27 12:02 Zhivago          orflon: That's because you can't write it like 11110000 in C.
2008-11-27 12:02 dbtid            well, C has no support for binary constants.  you can use decimal, octal or hexadecimal.

2008-11-27 12:36 Zhivago          Either is fairly trivial for ascii.

2008-11-27 13:03 lard-Vader       But why padding?
2008-11-27 13:03 Zhivago          A struct needs to be of the correct length to be in an array.
2008-11-27 13:03 Draconx|Laptop   because an implementation is allowed to place arbitrary padding bytes after any member of a structure.
2008-11-27 13:03 Zhivago          Arrays may not pad their elements.
2008-11-27 13:03 lard-Vader       ok
2008-11-27 13:03 Zhivago          Therefore it is necessary for a struct to be able to be padded for the above to be true.

2008-11-27 13:43 basix            hello all. i'm mmap()ing a file. When I try to sprintf() some location, if that location is < size of the file, I get a SIGBUS. I understand that this is because, I'm trying to write to a portion of the file which doesn't exist. But isn't it mmap's duty to synchronize between the virtual memory and the file? Am I missing some point? or is this the correct behavior and I'll have to manually zero out the file before I mmap it into memory?
2008-11-27 13:43 twkm             lard-Vader: you write sizeof header - sizeof header.charset, i.e., you write the length and charset_size members but not the pointer, but you read sizeof header which includes the pointer.  also, not that it matters, but you write 1,charset_size but read charset_size,1 -- minor symmetry discrepency.

2008-11-27 13:48 basix            twkm, okay, i looked at ftruncate. it wont destroy the content already present, right? so if i do something like, open(), ftruncate() and then mmap(), it ought to work?
2008-11-27 13:48 twkm             provided you ftruncate to a size greater than current, nothing will be destroyed.
2008-11-27 13:48 twkm             make it smaller, and those bytes go bye-bye.

2008-12-03 09:18 Brocolli         Yeah
2008-12-03 09:19 Spark            Brocolli: then you recurse and execute these new lines
2008-12-03 09:19 Brocolli         well I use a for loop
2008-12-03 09:19 nooga            Spark: what is that language you develop?
2008-12-03 09:19 Spark            x10
2008-12-03 09:19 Spark            you want a function execute(char **lines, int start, int end) or something like that
2008-12-03 09:20 Spark            when it hits a repeat, it calls itself
2008-12-03 09:20 Spark            with the same lines param
2008-12-03 09:20 lebafar_         hey guys, is it possible to order a linked list with shell sort algorithm?
2008-12-03 09:20 Spark            but a different start and end
2008-12-03 09:20 Brocolli         Spark, how can I allow my repeat to properly read the repeat from my function, and get the lines and print/do whatever it wants (whatever lies in between) but also still allow it to handle the situation where the repeat may not be in a function
2008-12-03 09:20 Spark            it calls itself n times
2008-12-03 09:20 Spark            you write it so it can execute arbitrary blocks of code
2008-12-03 09:20 Spark            then it doesn't matter whether you're in a function or not
2008-12-03 09:20 jsjones96        /part ##c 
2008-12-03 09:21 Spark            it just iterates down the block doing something special for each line depending on your strcmp stuff
2008-12-03 09:21 Spark            that "something special" for repeat involes scanning beyond, looking for the end
2008-12-03 09:21 jsjones96        /join 
2008-12-03 09:21 Spark            and then calling execute() n times on the loop's body

2008-12-03 09:21 crosvera         /join 
2008-12-03 09:21 Brocolli         so you want my function to repeat if the case presents itself?

2008-12-03 09:22 dbtid            Brocolli: if i was doing this, i'd create a structure to hold the repeats, with a linked list (or you could use a dynamically allocated block).
2008-12-03 09:22 maasha           Spark: thanks, over and out.
2008-12-03 09:22 Brocolli         I did that dbtid
2008-12-03 09:22 Brocolli         I also did that for my functions
2008-12-03 09:22 dbtid            then i would add things to it until i saw the end

2008-12-03 09:22 Brocolli         The problem is handling the repeat in the functions
2008-12-03 09:22 nooga            ehh
2008-12-03 09:22 Brocolli         I got it storing perfect, for both
2008-12-03 09:22 Brocolli         The problem is when I call a function I have to do repeats that are in the function by sending it to repeat.
2008-12-03 09:23 dbtid            so you have a structure that represents a) what to repeat, and b) how many times to repeat it.
2008-12-03 09:23 dbtid            this is pretty straight forward
2008-12-03 09:23 Brocolli         yes I have this man
2008-12-03 09:23 Brocolli         The problem is I can ahve "nested"repeats
2008-12-03 09:24 Brocolli         so in my function I can have a repeat, but i have to hold this as a function
2008-12-03 09:24 Spark            Brocolli: this is why you have to use recursion
2008-12-03 09:24 Spark            do you know what recursion is?
2008-12-03 09:24 Brocolli         yes, they said no recursion is required
2008-12-03 09:24 chontrite        /join 
2008-12-03 09:24 Spark            recursion is never required but it's usually a pain in the arse to not use it
2008-12-03 09:25 Brocolli         dbtid: Nested repeats are a bitch man, because right now I have a repeat function that creates a pointer for repeats and holds them like a function, but now when my function has repeats I have to send those somehow to my repeat function and treat them exactly the way repeat would treat its pointer if the repeats were external
2008-12-03 09:26 dbtid            as Spark said, recursion makes this trivial
2008-12-03 09:26 dbtid            but recursion can be simulated
2008-12-03 09:27 dbtid            you could use a stack to hold the current repeat while you execute a new one
2008-12-03 09:27 Brocolli         dbtid: Again man, it's the nested repeats... In my function
2008-12-03 09:27 Brocolli         so the repeats are already stored.
2008-12-03 09:28 Spark            you need to store the state though
2008-12-03 09:28 Spark            where you are in the programe
2008-12-03 09:28 Spark            i.e. 3 times through the first loop, 5 times through the nested loop
2008-12-03 09:28 Brocolli         Well when I get to call I have the conditions, problem si that when my function holds call and I'm in "call" I only have an fgets(line...) to hold the input from the inputfile if there was that repeat. There is no condition to handle it in functions eyt :(

2009-01-30 14:39 micols           i guess all ncurses take x and y coordinates

2009-01-30 14:43 micols           why use malloc if block scope does free the locally alloced variables after return?
2009-01-30 14:43 micols           then malloc would only be useful in main() ?
2009-01-30 14:44 micols           unless you have very long functions of course
2009-01-30 14:44 pstickne         micols:  huh?
2009-01-30 14:44 SlashLife        micols: You use malloc if you want something to live outside of scoping.
2009-01-30 14:44 micols           local variables are freed after return of a function
2009-01-30 14:44 theatrus         block scoped malloc is not freed automatically?
2009-01-30 14:44 theatrus         malloc is always "global"
2009-01-30 14:45 micols           yes, thats why i wonder if one should use malloc at all , most of the time :)
2009-01-30 14:45 SlashLife        That's not guaranteed.
2009-01-30 14:45 pstickne         micols:  the variables are 'released'; the contents are. what you get from malloc is stored in a variable.
2009-01-30 14:45 pstickne         *the contents are not (or rather, if they are pointers, what they pointer values refer to are not)
2009-01-30 14:45 SlashLife        Most OSes free all the process memory on termination, but this behaviour is not guaranteed by the standard.
2009-01-30 14:46 micols           void myfunc() { char b[255];  return 0; } is b free'ed ?
2009-01-30 14:46 pstickne         micols:  I generally like to avoid using malloc -- keeping it pushed up from the bottom

2009-01-30 14:47 micols           http://pastebin.com/mc499483 so this makes no sense?:P
2009-01-30 14:47 felipe           micols: the b[255]; is allocated on the stack, and vanishes when myfunc() returns
2009-01-30 14:47 micols           guess i should have used local variables instead :)
2009-01-30 14:48 micols           instead of global malloc
2009-01-30 14:48 SlashLife        micols: WTF?
2009-01-30 14:48 SlashLife        Err ...
2009-01-30 14:48 SlashLife        micols: Disregard that ...
2009-01-30 14:48 SlashLife        I was preparing a post to you and had some unexpected behaviour by Firefox.

2009-01-30 14:52 psychoschlumpf   that doesnt make sense
