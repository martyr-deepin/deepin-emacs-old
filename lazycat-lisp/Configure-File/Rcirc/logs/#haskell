2008-10-31 20:14 saft             i downloaded cabal-install and untared it. it is now in ~/Download
2008-10-31 20:14 saft             should i run Setup there or move it somewhere?
2008-10-31 20:14 ivanm            no, you can't use cabal-install to install Haskell-mode ;-)
2008-10-31 20:14 ivanm            saft: IIRC, there's an all-in-one installation script for cabal-install
2008-10-31 20:15 saft             i have haskell-mode working already
2008-10-31 20:15 byorgey          saft: either way, you shouldn't have to move it.
2008-10-31 20:15 saft             i apparently need cabal,htt,zlib and libghc6-network-dev

2008-10-31 20:16 byorgey          right, this is where the all-in-one installation script comes in handy =)

2008-10-31 20:26 saml             hugo_, all functions take 1 argument only. so it's probably easy to split up
2008-10-31 20:26 ivanm            saft: probably a new dependency that the script wasn't updated to cover
2008-10-31 20:26 ivanm            or else it could be talking about the _real_ zlib (not the haskell bindings)
2008-10-31 20:26 hugo_            http://hpaste.org/11638
2008-10-31 20:27 ivanm            in which case, it's not so easy to check if it's available
2008-10-31 20:27 hugo_            hmm
2008-10-31 20:27 Saizan           the script covers the haskell zlib
2008-10-31 20:27 saml             hugo_, for that, I'd use custom data record
2008-10-31 20:27 hugo_            oh

2008-10-31 20:28 saml             you would still have to do performSerach (A bot curr_day..

2008-10-31 20:28 hugo_            yes, i see
2008-10-31 20:28 EvilTerran       you could use a record, tho
2008-10-31 20:28 quicksilver      hugo_: is one way of doing it.
2008-10-31 20:28 saml             let's try to  split  f a b c d e = ...     to 5 functions that take 1 argument each
2008-10-31 20:28 quicksilver      hugo_: (I pasted it)
2008-10-31 20:28 quicksilver      I disagree with saml.
2008-10-31 20:28 quicksilver      I wouldn't bother with a custom record
2008-10-31 20:28 quicksilver      if it's only used once.
2008-10-31 20:29 quicksilver      I would if you have many functions taking this set of arguments.
2008-10-31 20:29 EvilTerran       well, there's two functions taking very similar sets of arguments right there
2008-10-31 20:29 saml             is it possible to split f a b = ... into   g a = ...   h b = ..   f = g . h  or something?
2008-10-31 20:29 hugo_            yes, far more elegant
2008-10-31 20:29 hugo_            thanks
2008-10-31 20:30 saft             wtf...

2008-10-31 20:35 luite            saft: if you need to compile that module, you'll probably need to install the development files for zlib
2008-10-31 20:35 EvilTerran       byorgey, if you're most familiar with dynamically typed (at best) languages, haskell and C would seem similar by virtue of both being statically typed

2008-10-31 20:52 marcot           Hello. When I use ghc-pkg list with a fresh new user I get a complete list.  With my user, I don't get some packages
2008-10-31 20:52 marcot           This is not about the user installed packages, is about system wide packages (packaged by debian)

2008-10-31 21:16 Herbi            does anyone have a good idea? or maybe an "outline" of the code, so that i only need to implement the given rules?
2008-10-31 21:16 int-e            C-Keen: so just pass the IO (GHC.IOBase.Handle, GHC.IOBase.Handle, GHC.IOBase.Handle, ProcessHandle) action?

2008-10-31 21:36 ivanm            BeelsebobWork_: though realistically, how can one tell if a closed-source app uses MIT-licensed stuff, without doing a binary inspection?
2008-10-31 21:36 BeelsebobWork_   you can't
2008-10-31 21:36 ivanm            oh? I thought they were equivalent...
2008-10-31 21:36 BeelsebobWork_   but you can't tell with GPLed stuff either
2008-10-31 21:36 ivanm            true
2008-10-31 21:36 ivanm            except with MIT/BSD stuff, it's easier to "fix" it by having an attribution hidden away somewhere in your voluminous documentation
2008-10-31 21:37 BeelsebobWork_   the other argument against GPLed code that I have is that it stops a lot of useful people contributing to it
2008-10-31 21:37 ivanm            whereas if someone finds GPL-code in your code, you have to either re-write or re-license
2008-10-31 21:37 ivanm            BeelsebobWork_: oh? as in people whose companies forbid them, etc.?
2008-10-31 21:37 BeelsebobWork_   e.g. the company I work for will use BSD/MIT code, and contribute back to the projects
2008-10-31 21:37 BeelsebobWork_   in fact, it's started several BSD/MIT licensed projects
2008-10-31 21:37 dblhelix         /join 
2008-10-31 21:37 ivanm            oh? which company is this?
2008-10-31 21:37 BeelsebobWork_   Anygma
2008-10-31 21:38 BeelsebobWork_   but there's several GPLed libraries that we would have used, but can't becasue of the GPL
2008-10-31 21:38 BeelsebobWork_   so those libraries didn't get our contributions
2008-10-31 21:38 ivanm            BeelsebobWork_: MIT license looks identical to BSD-2 to me...
2008-10-31 21:39 FunctorSalad     /join

2008-10-31 21:40 BeelsebobWork_   teratorn: exactly -- specifically the restriction we don't want to comply with is that we have large amounts of our own code that will get linked against the GPLed code, and will thus have to be open sourced
2008-10-31 21:40 teratorn         BeelsebobWork_: yeah that's the typical scenario
2008-10-31 21:40 BeelsebobWork_   thus, we'll quite happily contributed to BSD projects
2008-10-31 21:40 Taejo            ivanm: well it combines haskell and 3D, which interest me... therefore, I suspect it's interesting

2008-10-31 21:41 BeelsebobWork_   yeh
2008-10-31 21:41 teratorn         open source is here to stay, Now. and it doesn't need the GPL anymore, really
2008-10-31 21:41 BeelsebobWork_   damn static linking everywhere
2008-10-31 21:41 teratorn         perhaps it the past it was useful.. I'm not sure

2008-10-31 21:41 ivanm            nominolo|msr: because of static linking?
2008-10-31 21:41 nominolo|msr     ivanm: that and cross-module inlining
2008-10-31 21:41 Taejo            teratorn: I think it still has its place
2008-10-31 21:41 ivanm            teratorn: s/open source/free software/ :p
2008-10-31 21:41 teratorn         perhaps there are a few niches where it makes sense
2008-10-31 21:41 teratorn         Linux kernel might be one
2008-10-31 21:41 ivanm            Taejo: yeah... like stopping companies from ripping off the linux kernel
2008-10-31 21:42 teratorn         5 or 10 years ago I can just imagine microsoft forking and extending linux
2008-10-31 21:42 teratorn         or one of the commercial unix vendors
2008-10-31 21:42 nominolo|msr     teratorn: unlikely, but, sure, possible
2008-10-31 21:43 BeelsebobWork_   my biggest problem with GPL is that it preaches that it's Free Software
2008-10-31 21:43 BeelsebobWork_   when in reality it's heavily restricted software
2008-10-31 21:43 teratorn         what I mean is, I can imagine them doing it *if* it wasn't GPL
2008-10-31 21:43 nominolo|msr     BeelsebobWork_: it's a different kind of "free" ;)

2008-10-31 21:47 BeelsebobWork_   indeed
2008-10-31 21:47 BeelsebobWork_   I think quicksilver and I already had this argument and agreed exactly that

2008-10-31 21:47 quicksilver      if nominolo|msr's quoted phrase was accurate, it would be iniquitous indeed.
2008-10-31 21:48 quicksilver      which is why I decided to speak up :)
2008-10-31 21:48 BeelsebobWork_   heh
2008-10-31 21:48 BeelsebobWork_   the problem I have is with the use of the term "make derivitive works of"
2008-10-31 21:48 BeelsebobWork_   in that that can often mean "change completely, but retain 3 files"

2008-10-31 21:51 ivanm            then release a patch to the original
2008-10-31 21:51 ivanm            at least it's better than the gnuplot license: "you can't fork this, all you can do is release patches" :s
2008-10-31 21:51 Philippa         Beelsebob: the problem is that it's tricky to define the differences in a way that works, legally
2008-10-31 21:51 BeelsebobWork_   I see no reason why they shouldn't be allowed to do that -- after all, all that will happen if its closed is that someone else will make the same changes and release it for free
2008-10-31 21:52 Philippa         right, so actually what you mean is you prefer the BSD license anyway
2008-10-31 21:52 Philippa         yeah, fair enough
2008-10-31 21:52 Philippa         but it does make some sense /if/ you understand the ideology
2008-10-31 21:52 mapreduce        I'd like to see the GPL defeated in court.
2008-10-31 21:52 BeelsebobWork_   Philippa: yeh, I think I fail at case analysis -- I was trying to analyse the cases in terms of company B making small, medium or large changes to the code -- and assert that I don't mind them closed sourcing their changes in any of the cases
2008-10-31 21:52 Philippa         you don't have to agree with it
2008-10-31 21:52 BeelsebobWork_   yeh, exactly -- and I don't
2008-10-31 21:53 Philippa         I tend to release BSD myself, partly because the community I grew up via had an important relationship with commercial release
2008-10-31 21:53 Philippa         like, no commercial release = massive limitations on what you can actually achieve

2008-10-31 21:58 Philippa         (in most cases I do think GPLed libraries are a bad idea...)
2008-10-31 21:58 ketil            mapreduce: but your worry is that you are not able to make derived works of GPL software under another license, no?
2008-10-31 21:58 mapreduce        Philippa: I think ideally all or at least most software should be able to be treated as bags of libraries.
2008-10-31 21:59 Philippa         mapreduce: I think enforcing /that/ is a really incredibly bad idea
2008-10-31 21:59 mapreduce        ketil: where derived works means "linked to", as in "project X uses functions from library Y".
2008-10-31 21:59 Herbi            /quit Remote closed the connection
2008-10-31 21:59 Philippa         but yes, a lot more software should be written with a significant collection of libraries involved
2008-10-31 22:00 Philippa         yeah. You can, of course, run library Y via a wrapper in another, GPLed, process...
2008-10-31 22:00 astrobunny|afk   /join 
2008-10-31 22:00 scook0_          /join 
2008-10-31 22:00 mapreduce        Yes.
2008-10-31 22:00 ketil            mapreduce, I don't think that suffices as "derived work", but whatever.  I don't see why anybody but the library author gets to decide its licensing.
2008-10-31 22:00 mapreduce        This is where the distinction between derive and use starts to look arbitrary.
2008-10-31 22:00 mapreduce        Because it is. :)
2008-10-31 22:01 ketil            mapreduce, and if you don't like the licensing, you are free to write a replacement library.
2008-10-31 22:01 Philippa         ketil: the problem is that you end up deriving from the interface, which is under the same license
2008-10-31 22:01 Philippa         (and part of the same work, of course)
2008-10-31 22:01 ketil            I'm not convinced using an API counts as deriving.
2008-10-31 22:01 Philippa         it's rather hard for it not to in C's case
2008-10-31 22:02 mapreduce        ketil: The library author should get to decide their own licence, but they shouldn't get to decide mine.
2008-10-31 22:02 dcoutts          if you make a new impl of that API then that's one thing
2008-10-31 22:02 quicksilver      ketil: nobody knows.
2008-10-31 22:02 quicksilver      ketil: it's never been tested in law.
2008-10-31 22:02 quicksilver      (as far as I can remember).

2008-10-31 22:02 dcoutts          but if you say you're only using that API but then get the user to use the origianl impl then it just looks like you're trying to get around the license
2008-10-31 22:02 Philippa         mapreduce: eh, they're perfectly in their right to decide they're only willing to make it available to projects licensed a certain way
2008-10-31 22:02 binrapt_u        /quit Connection timed out
2008-10-31 22:02 quicksilver      I think it's possible to argue that by packaging something as a 'library' and providing an 'API' for it you are giving implicit permission to link that API.

2008-10-31 22:03 Philippa         quicksilver: to the extent that the library is licensed, yes
2008-10-31 22:03 quicksilver      Philippa: *nods*
2008-10-31 22:03 mapreduce        Philippa: I don't think they should be allowed to do that.
2008-10-31 22:03 dcoutts          quicksilver: unless you're giving explicit permission under a specific license
2008-10-31 22:03 mapreduce        It's an unreasonable restriction, as the monster-EULAs for Windows and Apple stuff embody.
2008-10-31 22:03 ketil            mapreduce, you get to choose your own license, but you need to comply with the licenses on other software that you use.
2008-10-31 22:04 Philippa         mapreduce: no, it's not in the same class at all
2008-10-31 22:04 mapreduce        I wanted to ask RMS this question when I saw him speak, but didn't manage to..
2008-10-31 22:04 quicksilver      anyhow, I wasn't trying to convince anyone. Just clearly state the case.
2008-10-31 22:04 Philippa         for example, that would mean no "free to free projects, costs for commercial" licenses...
2008-10-31 22:04 ketil            mapreduce, I think it is unreasonable to expect to use software without respecting its licensing.
2008-10-31 22:04 quicksilver      the point that hadn't been made was the moral one: and free software was originally a moral thing.
2008-10-31 22:05 mapreduce        "If I invented an equivalent licence to the GPL, called FOO, would GPL and FOO be compatible?"
2008-10-31 22:05 xmux             No
2008-10-31 22:05 quicksilver      mapreduce: yes, they would.

2008-10-31 22:05 ketil            Sure, as long as you don't add any further restrictions.
2008-10-31 22:05 quicksilver      mapreduce: because the GPL merely requires that you abide by all its rules. If FOOs rules are the same rules, then abiding by the GPL rules is also abiding by the FOO rules and vice versa
2008-10-31 22:06 mapreduce        Ok.
2008-10-31 22:06 quicksilver      in generaly when you have a composite work containing N pieces of software
2008-10-31 22:06 xmux             The GPL requires you to license derivative works under the GPL not under an equivalent copyleft license
2008-10-31 22:06 quicksilver      you have to obey all of their licenses at once
2008-10-31 22:06 quicksilver      xmux: that's doesn't mean what you think it means.
2008-10-31 22:06 Philippa         xmux: yeah, but you effectively have the right to do that
2008-10-31 22:06 Philippa         you just have to distribute under /both/ licenses
2008-10-31 22:07 quicksilver      mapreduce: so the "compatibility" question is whether it is actually possible to obey all N licenses at once
2008-10-31 22:07 mapreduce        Ok, I see.
2008-10-31 22:07 quicksilver      mapreduce: if they somehow contradict each other, then you can't obey them all; that's what people mean by incompatibility
2008-10-31 22:07 Philippa         to put it another way: structural equivalence

2008-10-31 22:15 nominolo|msr     C-Keen: there's an argument missing to process_wrapper, isn't there?
2008-10-31 22:15 Igloo            You want find_bash :: IO String (well, FilePath) presumbaly

2008-10-31 22:16 quicksilver      C-Keen: your type error in the first instances is because process_wrapper takes two arguments and you only gave it one
2008-10-31 22:16 mapreduce        ketil: No, I don't have a problem with a specific library.
2008-10-31 22:17 nominolo|msr     Igloo: oh, indeed
2008-10-31 22:17 quicksilver      it's at times like this that it's pretty unhelpful that (->) is a monad, in fact ;)
2008-10-31 22:17 mapreduce        ketil: But in general I don't think the set of things a licence can impose should include the licence the user must use.
2008-10-31 22:17 nominolo|msr     C-Keen: it's typically helpful to add type signatures, since otherwise it's tricky to know where the actual error occurs

2008-10-31 22:18 quicksilver      the separation between use and derivation is pretty routine.

2008-10-31 22:36 idnar            maybe "rai'n-dahl" would be a better informal transliteration
2008-10-31 22:37 idnar            although I guess these things are highly dependent on your accent

2008-10-31 22:37 idnar            I'm mostly going by my knowledge of Afrikaans, I'm not so good at reading IPA
2008-10-31 22:38 quicksilver      "dijkstra" is pronounced something very like "dike-stra"
2008-10-31 22:38 quicksilver      so I was expecting "rijn" to be "rhine"
2008-10-31 22:39 idnar            wikipedia has "ˈdɛɪkstra" for Dijkstra
2008-10-31 22:39 Deewiant         as was I, but the IPA disagrees

2008-10-31 22:39 quicksilver      I always think it's very ironic that dijkstra didn't invent tensors
2008-10-31 22:39 Deewiant         interestingly the two 'i's are different there
2008-10-31 22:39 quicksilver      he was clearly destined too.
2008-10-31 22:39 Twey             'Rain-darl'
2008-10-31 22:40 idnar            "dike-stra" sounds weird
2008-10-31 22:40 quicksilver      well maybe it's wrong; but it's how I've heard it spoken in the UK.
2008-10-31 22:40 Deewiant         hm, now I'd really like to know if the 'dike' is an approximation for english-speakers who can't pronounce 'day-k' or some such
2008-10-31 22:41 quicksilver      that's quite possible.
2008-10-31 22:41 ivanm            anyone know what darcsum's "add changelog" option does?
2008-10-31 22:41 quicksilver      I think I can pronounce "day-k" but maybe I'm not pronouncing the thing you want me to pronounce ;)
2008-10-31 22:41 opqdonut         afaik it's "die-kshtra"

2008-10-31 22:41 Deewiant         it could also depend on your /dutch/ accent

2008-10-31 22:43 Deewiant         opqdonut: I meant that \subset = ⊆
2008-10-31 22:43 idnar            that character looks awful on the same line as monospace text
2008-10-31 22:43 Deewiant         your font is just awful :-P
2008-10-31 22:43 earthy           dijkstra would most accurately be pronounced as dyke stra
2008-10-31 22:43 opqdonut         Deewiant: the character set IPA is a subset of the character set unicode
2008-10-31 22:43 earthy           but even then it's off
2008-10-31 22:43 quicksilver      that's how I pronounce, but not how idnar's dutchman does

2008-10-31 22:44 idnar            I would expect it to be pronounced something like "dykstra" would be in Afrikaans
2008-10-31 22:44 arjanb           dijkstra is not really dutch but frisian

2008-11-02 12:19 Axman6           well, the tree i'm making, each value produces the same subtree from it, so if i start at 1, and then i get to putting in a 1 again, it's just a waste, i should just stop the tree there

Second, I have read "Real World Haskell", it's great, so have any others book or website that intro about network programming with Haskell ? Thanks :)
2008-11-03 17:10 unenough         but also, Float does have a maximum representable value that isn't infinity
2008-11-03 17:10 BeelsebobWork    > (1 / 0) :: Int
2008-11-03 17:10 lambdabot              No instance for (Fractional Int)
2008-11-03 17:10 lambdabot               arising from a use of `/' at <i...
2008-11-03 17:10 Deewiant         unenough: yes, but you can still go up from there and get infinity
2008-11-03 17:10 BeelsebobWork    > (1 `div` 0) :: Int
2008-11-03 17:10 lambdabot          * Exception: divide by zero
2008-11-03 17:10 thoughtpolice    Heooo: yes, and using another form of reduction you can change the names of bound variables
2008-11-03 17:10 BeelsebobWork    how does one get a NaN?
2008-11-03 17:10 thoughtpolice    to help avoid conflict
2008-11-03 17:11 Deewiant         unenough: I mean, I see your point, but I can also see the point of not making it bounded

2008-11-03 17:14 unenough         the IEEE float maybe just should exist in haskell?

2008-11-03 17:15 dmwit            Deewiant: But then, floats don't satisfy the associativity of (+), either.
2008-11-03 17:15 dmwit            So what the hell.

2008-11-03 17:19 dmwit            Cheery: They can be applied to any function.
2008-11-03 17:20 icherevan        /join 
2008-11-03 17:20 Cheery           you mean you do not just take everything operator-looking into a list and solve that out?
2008-11-03 17:20 dmwit            There is a proposal to do that.
2008-11-03 17:20 mmorrow          Cheery: err, but actually the precedence is worked out after parsing without regard for precedence actually i believe
2008-11-03 17:20 dmwit            I'm hoping it gets into Haskell'.

2008-11-03 17:21 dmwit            Sounds good to me.
2008-11-03 17:21 Cheery           in the end it wont have such machinery to the user, because it can burn ppl badly
2008-11-03 17:21 dmwit            You should allow arbitrary real-valued precedences, too. ;-)
2008-11-03 17:21 Cheery           but for development its useful if I could define operators in fly :)
2008-11-03 17:22 unenough         CReal is unlimited precision?
2008-11-03 17:22 dmwit            unenough: Sort of.
2008-11-03 17:22 dmwit            unenough: Unlimited up to machine memory.
2008-11-03 17:22 Cheery           dmwit: just wondering about how to solve precedence in that manner?
2008-11-03 17:22 unenough         of course, and world supply of tissue paper too
2008-11-03 17:22 dmwit            right =)
2008-11-03 17:23 mmorrow          so "1 + 1 * 1" gets parsed initially as ((1 + 1) * 1), then after all the fixity declarations have been seen (after the AST has been constructed), it does another pass to fix the tree up given those precedences
2008-11-03 17:23 Cheery           I could write a small LR-parser for that only, but I wonder whether there's smarter way
2008-11-03 17:23 mmorrow          haskell is way hard to parse
2008-11-03 17:23 mmorrow          since it not context-dependent

2008-11-03 17:25 unenough         why is that better? how do you know where the + was
2008-11-03 17:25 Cheery           ie. 1 < n < 5 turns to: 1 < n & n < 5

2008-11-03 18:07 BeelsebobWork    depends if you're trying to teach them recursion for example
2008-11-03 18:07 Deewiant         if you're writing map, it's helpful.
2008-11-03 18:07 yitz             he
2008-11-03 18:07 mm_freak         /join 
2008-11-03 18:08 yitz             If you're teaching recursion, say "use recursion".
2008-11-03 18:08 BeelsebobWork    indeed
2008-11-03 18:08 BeelsebobWork    "use recursion -- not map"
2008-11-03 18:08 Deewiant         And wonder why they don't learn. ;-)
2008-11-03 18:08 BeelsebobWork    nothing wrong with starting people off with primitive recursion
2008-11-03 18:09 yitz             When they teach recursion in C or Pascal, they don't prohibit while.
2008-11-03 18:09 ivanm            yitz: where in the dictionary, the definition of recursion is "see recursion"? ;-)
2008-11-03 18:09 yitz             he
2008-11-03 18:09 BeelsebobWork    yitz: sure they do -- they say "use recursion for this" and mark you down if you use while to do it, not recursion
2008-11-03 18:10 yitz             well, you can also use while if you want, but the main iteration needs to be recursion.
2008-11-03 18:10 BeelsebobWork    I would certainly mark you down if you did that
2008-11-03 18:11 BeelsebobWork    if the assessment says "use recursion" it means it
2008-11-03 18:11 yitz             BeelsebobWork: I don't think starting off with primitive recursion is necessarily the right approach, but I guess it depends on the basic goal of the course.
2008-11-03 18:11 BeelsebobWork    yitz: yeh, I agree
2008-11-03 18:11 BeelsebobWork    but I can imagine many courses that do start off with it
2008-11-03 18:11 BeelsebobWork    the UKC on certainly starts with higher order functions
2008-11-03 18:12 BeelsebobWork    and then says "oh hay, you can write these if you like"
2008-11-03 18:12 roderyk          /join 
2008-11-03 18:14 yitz             I would start with simple things written the way we really write them, building a vocabulary of basic tools. Then motivate recursion with things that can't easily be written using existing tools without recursion.
2008-11-03 18:15 O_4              /quit "Come alive!"
2008-11-03 18:15 yitz             You might then mention that recursion is actually more primitive and that the basic tools are written that way.
2008-11-03 18:16 yitz             For advanced programmers who are learning Haskell, you might start with recursion, but also in that case you wouldn't need those silly exercises.
2008-11-03 18:16 BeelsebobWork    I think you would need them
2008-11-03 18:16 BeelsebobWork    most advanced programmers are used to going "pft, recursion, that's inefficient"
2008-11-03 18:16 yitz             They know what recursion is.
2008-11-03 18:16 BeelsebobWork    and have very little experience with it
2008-11-03 18:16 BeelsebobWork    yeh, but they have next-to-no experience with thinking in a recursive way
2008-11-03 18:17 Deewiant         The 'head recursion' style in particular is quite unique to haskell IMO
2008-11-03 18:17 Lemmih           Dependencies between finalizers  in GHC is a no-go, right?
2008-11-03 18:17 Deewiant         Or to lazy languages in general, I guess
2008-11-03 18:18 yitz             Deewiant: true. but it would be more natural to introduce it later on, for problems that really need it. not to start out by misleading them about what Haskell code is supposed to look like.
2008-11-03 18:19 BeelsebobWork    yitz: I think that the problem is that 1st year students have seen very little maths, and are not good at thinking compositionaly
2008-11-03 18:19 Deewiant         Well, 'problems that really need it' == almost anything that returns a list, for instance. :-)
2008-11-03 18:19 BeelsebobWork    so trying to imediately immerse them in compositional style is not entirely useful
2008-11-03 18:19 BeelsebobWork    they just end up going "what the shit, I can't write anything in this language"
2008-11-03 18:19 SubStack         delicious lists :)
2008-11-03 18:19 yitz             Deewiant: not really, I use lists all the time and usually don't need raw recursion.
2008-11-03 18:20 Deewiant         yitz: well yeah, but the HOFs you use need it.
2008-11-03 18:20 BeelsebobWork    Deewiant: yeh, but he was asserting that the course should teach the HOFs
2008-11-03 18:20 yitz             Deewiant: they also need branches in the assembler code they generate, so what?
2008-11-03 18:20 BeelsebobWork    and then later say "oh, btw, if the HOFs aren't enough, do this instead"
2008-11-03 18:20 Deewiant         yitz: so tell them about that, too.
2008-11-03 18:21 yitz             Deewiant: ok -- some day.
2008-11-03 18:21 BeelsebobWork    this is an age old computing problem though
2008-11-03 18:21 hansfbaier       /part #haskell 
2008-11-03 18:21 BONUS            hmm
2008-11-03 18:21 yitz             start with the basics though. In idiomatic Haskell, recursion isn't basic.
2008-11-03 18:21 BeelsebobWork    should you approach things bottom up
2008-11-03 18:21 BeelsebobWork    or top down
2008-11-03 18:21 BONUS            Kleisli arrows using the identity monads are just normal function arrows. am i correct in thinking this?
2008-11-03 18:21 BONUS            s/monads/monad
2008-11-03 18:22 Deewiant         yitz: Depends on what you're doing. If you're implementing a data structure, for instance, it is.
2008-11-03 18:22 dv_              /quit "Gone"
2008-11-03 18:22 Deewiant         IMHO at least.
2008-11-03 18:22 BeelsebobWork    Deewiant: yes and no -- the first thing you do is write fmap, and then use HOFs again
2008-11-03 18:22 BeelsebobWork    having said that -- you need to be able to write fmap
2008-11-03 18:22 alc              /quit "Leaving"
2008-11-03 18:23 Deewiant         BeelsebobWork: good luck implementing set union with fmap, for instance ;-)
2008-11-03 18:23 BeelsebobWork    true, so you implement fold too
2008-11-03 18:23 yitz             Deewiant: yeah sometimes it is natural there - so introduce it when you get to that, if you haven't needed it yet.
2008-11-03 18:23 Deewiant         the fold might not have the wanted performance characteristics
2008-11-03 18:24 sjanssen         will you really be able to use fold if you don't know recursion?
2008-11-03 18:24 BeelsebobWork    it might not Deewiant -- but that's not the *first* think I'm thinking about when learning Haskel
2008-11-03 18:24 BeelsebobWork    sjanssen: I think so, yes
2008-11-03 18:24 BeelsebobWork    fold is an easy function to think about
2008-11-03 18:24 Deewiant         BeelsebobWork: true, it's arguable that doing that in the first place isn't very idiomatic. :-)
2008-11-03 18:25 yitz             Recursion is fundamental in the theory of computing, so if that's what you're teaching, it's certainly right at the beginning. But before someone takes a course in that, they should know some programming languages already.
2008-11-03 18:25 yitz             Including functional languages.
2008-11-03 18:25 L3v1             /quit 
2008-11-03 18:25 sjanssen         yitz: recusion is fundamental in the practice of programming, not just the theory
2008-11-03 18:26 BeelsebobWork    sjanssen: sure it is -- but we don't start people programming by introducing them to ASM
2008-11-03 18:26 BeelsebobWork    we start them by doing something higher level
2008-11-03 18:26 BeelsebobWork    and then filling in details later
2008-11-03 18:26 yitz             sjanssen: I claim that in Haskell, raw recursion is not the most basic technique.
2008-11-03 18:26 BeelsebobWork    hmm
2008-11-03 18:26 sjanssen         yitz: it is the most fundamental
2008-11-03 18:26 Deewiant         I claim that it is the most basic.
2008-11-03 18:26 yitz             sjanssen: not to say that it isn't important
2008-11-03 18:26 BeelsebobWork    I would claim that it is the most basic too
2008-11-03 18:27 sjanssen         "basic" is an overloaded term, I'm not sure what you mean by it
2008-11-03 18:27 yitz             sjanssen: ok. I'm thinking about a course that is teaching Haskell to first year CS students - as a language.
2008-11-03 18:28 sjanssen         yitz: "basic" means "easy"?
2008-11-03 18:28 yitz             sjanssen: in idiomatic Haskell, you usually use other techniques to iterate, not raw recursion. it's only in certain situations, or when the problem is difficult in some way, or if you need to optimize, that you use recursion.
2008-11-03 18:28 quicksilver      yitz: no you always use recursion
2008-11-03 18:28 quicksilver      yitz: every single time.
2008-11-03 18:29 quicksilver      haskell has no other looping construct.
2008-11-03 18:29 yitz             sjanssen: basic means simplest idiomatic usage.
2008-11-03 18:29 Raynes           /join 
2008-11-03 18:29 yitz             quicksilver: map, zip, iterate, folds.
2008-11-03 18:29 sjanssen         yitz: you basically need to use recursion every time your structure isn't a list
2008-11-03 18:30 BONUS            everything comes down to recursion, but that doesn't mean that you have to do explicit recursion
2008-11-03 18:30 magthe           /join 
2008-11-03 18:30 BONUS            even if you have trees, you can make them a functor and do fmap, which is implicit recursion
2008-11-03 18:30 BONUS            imho
2008-11-03 18:31 sjanssen         yitz: I also think "idiomatic" is not the most useful thing in CS 101, the goal is not to produce working Haskell programmers, the goal is to teach concepts
2008-11-03 18:31 KoenigGunther    /join 
2008-11-03 18:31 KoenigGunther    hi
2008-11-03 18:32 sjanssen         BONUS: but you can't write fmap for your tree without using recusion
2008-11-03 18:32 BeelsebobWork    sjanssen: yeh, that depends -- I personally wouldn't teach Haskel as a CS101
2008-11-03 18:32 BeelsebobWork    I'd do the SICP thing
2008-11-03 18:32 BeelsebobWork    and then teach Haskell in a later functional programming course
2008-11-03 18:32 BONUS            sjanssen: yeah, exactly
2008-11-03 18:32 BONUS            you can't write map without recursion either
2008-11-03 18:32 BeelsebobWork    which would be all about doing the powerful things like HOFs and producing monads etc
2008-11-03 18:32 magthe           is there already a function in the base modules like this:  foo a = a >> return ()
2008-11-03 18:32 yitz             sjanssen: the basic structures are pre-defined. You start out with those. The simplest user-defined data structures don't need recursion. You start out with those. Eventually, you'll get to recursion, yeah. It won't take that long. But by that time you certainly won't need to give exercises that say "write this function using the following crippled mutilated variation on Haskell..."
2008-11-03 18:32 Deewiant         magthe: nope
2008-11-03 18:33 sjanssen         you know, I'd probably cover recursion before lists
2008-11-03 18:33 quicksilver      yitz: all of those things are defined using recursion.
2008-11-03 18:33 magthe           Deewiant: oki, then I'll stop looking, thanks
2008-11-03 18:33 yitz             quicksilver: for a beginner, that's totally under the hood.
2008-11-03 18:33 sjanssen         magthe: yes, (>>return()) :)
2008-11-03 18:33 quicksilver      it shouldn't be.
2008-11-03 18:33 quicksilver      that's what "basic" means
2008-11-03 18:33 quicksilver      everything depends on recursion.
2008-11-03 18:33 BeelsebobWork    sjanssen: interesting -- I think I'd do lists first -- because the whole stepping down a list thing and getting to the [] slightly easier to grasp than just decrementing a number
2008-11-03 18:33 magthe           sjanssen: ;) I was aware of that one yes
2008-11-03 18:34 BeelsebobWork    quicksilver: even
2008-11-03 18:34 yitz             quicksilver: everything depends on storing bits in memory locations and branching with gotos, so let's start out beginners with that.
2008-11-03 18:35 sjanssen         yitz: that is a different kind of basic
2008-11-03 18:35 KoenigGunther    i've got a question regarding my homework in haskell... whe have to define a function composeMaybe with the following signature: composeMaybe :: (a -> Maybe b) -> (b -> Maybe c) -> (a -> Maybe c).
2008-11-03 18:35 KoenigGunther    when i have
2008-11-03 18:35 KoenigGunther    composeMaybe f g x,
2008-11-03 18:35 KoenigGunther    I tried to apply f to x to get a result of type Maybe b. To feed g with this result i have to write a function with mapps 'Maybe b' to 'b', right?

2008-11-03 18:37 PeakerWork       KoenigGunther: you can use pattern matching on (Just x) or Nothing. Or you can use "maybe" which is an alternative to pattern matching
2008-11-03 18:38 quicksilver      yitz: because recursion is the ONLY looping technique in haskell
2008-11-03 18:38 quicksilver      if you don't teach it to beginners
2008-11-03 18:38 quicksilver      they are immediately lost when they try to do something which doesn't obviously fit into a map or a fold.
2008-11-03 18:38 KoenigGunther    I tried to do it with 'maybe', but 'maybe' requires a fallback value, which I cannot specify
2008-11-03 18:38 perspectival     /join 
2008-11-03 18:38 quicksilver      actually recursion is an easier programming technique, because it is universal
2008-11-03 18:38 quicksilver      learning to express you algorithms using common, named, recursion patterns
2008-11-03 18:39 quicksilver      like zipWith and fold
2008-11-03 18:39 quicksilver      is a higher-order skill.
2008-11-03 18:39 sjanssen         KoenigGunther: think about the type you're ultimately returning
2008-11-03 18:39 quicksilver      the first skill is to understand how looping is possible at all.
2008-11-03 18:39 yitz             quicksilver: that's just my point. It isn't the only looping technique, and it's not the most commonly used. I don't care that the compiler happens to replace my looping constructs with recursion during the compilation process, that's not a topic for beginners.
2008-11-03 18:39 yitz             quicksilver: ok. start with iterate then.
2008-11-03 18:39 KoenigGunther    Ummmm, pretty hard for me at the moment :) I think I'll have to revise the definition of Maybe
2008-11-03 18:40 Deewiant         ?src Maybe
2008-11-03 18:40 lambdabot        data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
2008-11-03 18:40 sjanssen         KoenigGunther: no, the existing definition will work :)
2008-11-03 18:40 quicksilver      It is the only looping technique.
2008-11-03 18:40 quicksilver      and since it is the only one, it is the most commonly used
2008-11-03 18:40 quicksilver      it is the *only* one used.
2008-11-03 18:40 yitz             quicksilver: you never use iterate?
2008-11-03 18:40 quicksilver      haskell is not a language for people who are afraid to look at the source of iterate and map
2008-11-03 18:40 mapreduce        /join 
2008-11-03 18:40 quicksilver      the soruce of iterate and map are beautifully simple
2008-11-03 18:40 quicksilver      even beginners
2008-11-03 18:40 quicksilver      no *especially* beginners
2008-11-03 18:41 quicksilver      should look at that.
2008-11-03 18:41 sjanssen         KoenigGunther: a Maybe is either Just a value, or Nothing (no result).  In which cases would you want to use either of those options?
2008-11-03 18:41 yitz             quicksilver: true, but that's not the right way to start out beginners. it gives a distorted picture of how you program in Haskell.
2008-11-03 18:41 quicksilver      thinks like map and fold should not be thought of as magic black boxes, never to be looked inside
2008-11-03 18:41 quicksilver      they should be viewed as common idioms which are all the more beautiful because you could easily have written them yourselves.
2008-11-03 18:41 yitz             And these weird distorted exercises that people are always bringing here proves it.
2008-11-03 18:42 yitz             quicksilver: when you start learning something totally new, everything looks like a magic black box. it doesn't take long before most of them open up though.
2008-11-03 18:42 yitz             quicksilver: i'm not saying not to teach recursion. i'm just giving the following criterion:
2008-11-03 18:42 KoenigGunther    I am interested in the Just-value, since I can extract he value of type 'b'.
2008-11-03 18:43 KoenigGunther    The Nothing-value is confusing me right now, because I cannot immagine how to convert it into a 'b'-value
2008-11-03 18:43 sjanssen         KoenigGunther: so when the value is Just, what will you return?
2008-11-03 18:43 yitz             recursion should not be taught until you can give realistic exercises that don't force you to write stupid-looking unidiomatic Haskell.
2008-11-03 18:43 Deewiant         Nothing is a 'Maybe a' value, a 'Maybe b' value, and a 'Maybe c' value
2008-11-03 18:43 harinath         /join 
2008-11-03 18:44 sjanssen         yitz: you keep talking about idiomatic Haskell, but that is not what the first stages of learning a language are about
2008-11-03 18:44 KoenigGunther    If the value would be (Just x) x would be my returned value
2008-11-03 18:44 opqdonut         yitz: you have a point there
2008-11-03 18:44 opqdonut         writing folds explicitly is good style, expanding them out is not
2008-11-03 18:44 Deewiant         KoenigGunther: no it wouldn't, you're returning a 'Maybe c' not a 'c', remember?
2008-11-03 18:45 sjanssen         KoenigGunther: but x has the type 'c', not 'Maybe c'
2008-11-03 18:45 yitz             sjanssen: i don't think you're right. every other language i learned started out with things that were simple but idiomatic in that particular language. why does only Haskell have to start out by distorting things?
2008-11-03 18:45 magthe           /part #haskell 
2008-11-03 18:46 KoenigGunther    We're talking about the function help :: (a -> Maybe b) -> b, right?
2008-11-03 18:46 KoenigGunther    So my approach would be to define a pattern        help (Just x) = x     for the Just-case
2008-11-03 18:46 sjanssen         KoenigGunther: we're talking about the composeMaybe function as a whole
2008-11-03 18:47 KoenigGunther    ah, okay :)
2008-11-03 18:47 sjanssen         KoenigGunther: help :: (a -> Maybe b) -> b is a dead end

2008-11-03 18:49 RayNbow          yitz: but what would be a realistic recursion exercise?

2008-11-03 18:50 quicksilver      yitz: I think it's fine to start by playing with some idiomatic things like "map (+1) [2,3,4,5]"
2008-11-03 18:50 quicksilver      yitz: but it's hard to learn from those because they don't mean anything
2008-11-03 18:51 quicksilver      they're just fun patterns
2008-11-03 18:51 quicksilver      once you actually want to move on from playing "look this language is cool, it's really expressive" to "how would I actually solve my own problems in it?"
2008-11-03 18:51 quicksilver      then you have to address recursion.
2008-11-03 18:51 BeelsebobWork    quicksilver: you do?
2008-11-03 18:51 RayNbow          (gtg, be back in 1 hr)

2008-11-03 18:52 sjanssen         yitz: map solves exactly one problem, on exactly one structure
2008-11-03 18:53 quicksilver      BeelsebobWork: unlines, foldr, and lines are all recursive
2008-11-03 18:53 BeelsebobWork    quicksilver: yes -- but they're not explicit, primitive recursion
2008-11-03 18:53 quicksilver      indeed.
2008-11-03 18:53 BeelsebobWork    which is what yitz is arguing about
2008-11-03 18:53 quicksilver      no it's not.
2008-11-03 18:53 quicksilver      please read back, please understand
2008-11-03 18:53 quicksilver      I'm not going to explain it again.
2008-11-03 18:53 BeelsebobWork    he's saying "don't teach them explicit primitive recursion, teach them HOFs instead"
2008-11-03 18:53 yitz             sjanssen: you mean it's not enough to make the language Turing complete. Yeah. :)
2008-11-03 18:53 quicksilver      yes
2008-11-03 18:53 quicksilver      and Im' saying that teaching HOFs as black boxes is dire
2008-11-03 18:53 quicksilver      it's really poor teaching techniques
2008-11-03 18:54 BeelsebobWork    I don't think it is
2008-11-03 18:54 quicksilver      because you can't generalise from it
2008-11-03 18:54 quicksilver      HOFs are not black boxes
2008-11-03 18:54 quicksilver      in fact they almost all have one or two-line definitions
2008-11-03 18:54 BeelsebobWork    they are so -- if you treat them as such
2008-11-03 18:54 quicksilver      you should teach them *with* their definitions
2008-11-03 18:54 arjanb           /join 
2008-11-03 18:54 BeelsebobWork    in the same way as a while loop is not a black box -- it's a load of OSM

2008-11-03 18:54 BeelsebobWork    ASM**
2008-11-03 18:54 quicksilver      and then people can generalise them.
2008-11-03 18:54 yitz             quicksilver: you can defer that by a week or two.
2008-11-03 18:54 quicksilver      ah yes but the different is while loops are complete
2008-11-03 18:54 BeelsebobWork    sure -- but I think what he's arguing is that you go back and teach that 3 weeks later
2008-11-03 18:54 quicksilver      you can do anything with while loops
2008-11-03 18:54 BeelsebobWork    once they're already programming
2008-11-03 18:54 quicksilver      map lines and unlines are not compelte
2008-11-03 18:55 quicksilver      and you can't generalise form them to anything which is.
2008-11-03 18:55 BeelsebobWork    no, they're not -- but they're enough to get started
2008-11-03 18:55 quicksilver      yitz: two weeks, sure ;)
2008-11-03 18:55 quicksilver      that's fine.
2008-11-03 18:55 quicksilver      but not long
2008-11-03 18:55 quicksilver      you can't *really* teach haskell without teaching recursion
2008-11-03 18:55 BeelsebobWork    yeh, I don't think anyone's arguing that you can just not ever teach primitive recursion
2008-11-03 18:55 quicksilver      once you move out of the playground, you have to see how the slide was put toegether.
2008-11-03 18:55 BeelsebobWork    only that you can get people started in a playground
2008-11-03 18:55 yitz             quicksilver: that's all I'm saying. that's enough to be able to avoid distorting people's view of Haskell.
2008-11-03 18:56 yitz             first impressions have a lasting effect.
2008-11-03 18:56 sjanssen         CS 101 is supposed to do PR work for Haskell?
2008-11-03 18:56 BeelsebobWork    yeh, that's the bit I don't disagree with sjanssen
2008-11-03 18:56 BeelsebobWork    I don't think HOFs are useful in CS101
2008-11-03 18:56 BeelsebobWork    maybe in CS301 though
2008-11-03 18:57 yitz             can you image what happens to all the students who *don't* come to this channel to get straightened out when they are doing those crazy exercises?
2008-11-03 18:57 BeelsebobWork    "by the way, functional languages are really powerful because you can throw functions around everywhere" kind of stuff
2008-11-03 18:57 sjanssen         every CS course is full of moments where the professor goes "oh, but this is generalized in X Y and Z, and melts down to one line of code"
2008-11-03 18:57 yitz             sjanssen: I meant that they start out by getting into bad habits about how to think about a problem.
2008-11-03 18:57 BeelsebobWork    yitz: but the point of the crazy exercises is not to teach them Haskell
2008-11-03 18:57 BeelsebobWork    it's to teach them about recursion
2008-11-03 18:57 BeelsebobWork    the fact that they're using haskell is irrelevant
2008-11-03 18:58 BeelsebobWork    as is what idiomatic haskell looks like

2008-11-03 18:58 yitz             BeelsebobWork: so that's also part of the confusion. in cs 101 don't start out with computing theory during the first lecture. start out with a concrete language.
2008-11-03 18:59 BeelsebobWork    yitz: really?
2008-11-03 18:59 sjanssen         actually, you usually start with the syllabus :P
2008-11-03 18:59 BeelsebobWork    my first POP (principals of programming, essentially CS101) involved "hey, so what do we need to build a language that lets us do stuff"

2008-11-03 19:00 IsoPallo_        Hmm... I did :)
2008-11-03 19:00 BeelsebobWork    the point though is that what they were teaching is the basics of "programming languages need ways to express an atomic thing, and atomic computation, and ways of producing lots of things, and lots of computations"
2008-11-03 19:00 BeelsebobWork    they weren't teaching us scheme

2008-11-03 19:03 yitz             If they did it nowadays, they might start out first graders with category theory.
2008-11-03 19:03 yitz             it's quite general.

2008-11-03 19:09 vincenz          @tell dons I agree that 'get' is very cheap, computationally, but you did not address my main concern.  The reason why I want a branch to be even cheaper is if you want a LOT of branches, but not perse on different servers, with 'get' you'll have a lot of disk-space overhead.  The reason to have that many branches, is that then you could have a code-review system.  People mail their patch to the main repository, this creates a branch with a uni
2008-11-03 19:09 lambdabot        Consider it noted.
2008-11-03 19:10 unenough         looking through lambdabot's code, i see something like: String -> LB [String]
2008-11-03 19:10 unenough         what's LB?

2008-11-03 19:10 vincenz          I think it's an IO monad, potentially with some state to track the connection

2008-11-03 19:11 vincenz          People mail their patch to the main repository, this creates a branch with a unique number, and then you can review that code with regards  to the active version of the repository
2008-11-03 19:12 sjanssen         is there a version control system that actually works that way?
2008-11-03 19:12 vincenz          Yes
2008-11-03 19:12 vincenz          basically you want to separate the concept of patch and patch
2008-11-03 19:13 vincenz          You want something you submit, let's call it 'Patch' (capitalized)
2008-11-03 19:13 vincenz          And as code is reviewd, you submit 'patch'es to this 'Patch' until the reviewer's happy
2008-11-03 19:13 jimstutt         @tell dons hi, any chance of an status update on ghc-6.10.1 archlinux x86?
2008-11-03 19:13 lambdabot        Consider it noted.
2008-11-03 19:13 vincenz          With darcs this would work better than normal system,s since normal systems do not allow multiple 'Patch'es for one file

2008-11-03 19:13 vincenz          it's called a 'changelist'
2008-11-03 19:14 sjanssen         so, we both know that darcs can send several patches in a single bundle, what will this functionality gain?

2008-11-03 19:15 vincenz          so I can keep sending you darcs-patches and they fall into the same bundle, until you're happy, and then you submit that bundle to the main repo

2008-11-03 19:57 Cale             Right, if you need to shortcut, it must be foldr

2008-11-03 19:57 Saizan           the problem with foldr using (\x y -> if x == 0 then 0 else x*y), is that if you've a large list without 0 it will stack overflow
2008-11-03 19:57 mmorrow          since it'll stack overflow
2008-11-03 19:58 Saizan           you can use the Cont or Either e monad if you want a left fold that can shortcut

2008-11-03 20:04 KoenigGunther    Hi again! I still cant find a solution to my task to write a function 'composeMaybe :: (a -> Maybe b) -> (b -> Maybe c) -> (a -> Maybe c)' to compose two functions :( My problem still is to figure out how I have to pass the result of the first to the second function. The result of the first is of type 'Maybe b' and the input-type for the second function is 'b'
2008-11-03 20:05 Cale             KoenigGunther: right, so you have to pattern match the result of the first
2008-11-03 20:05 Cale             KoenigGunther: If it's Nothing, then you're going to want to return Nothing
2008-11-03 20:05 Cale             KoenigGunther: If it's Just x, then you want to pass it along to the second function.
2008-11-03 20:05 Cale             You can use a case expression to do that.

2008-11-03 20:07 Cale             In particular, you're going to turn it into a value of type Maybe c

2008-11-03 20:24 Cale             But there might be whole classes of effects which are missing from our view, and I'm not certain how to discover if that's the case.
2008-11-03 20:26 jsn              a supply monad?
2008-11-03 20:26 Cale             jsn: Yeah, hide get and put, and only provide something like  supply = do x <- get; put (x+1); return x
2008-11-03 20:27 jsn              when you say, a unique supply monad, you mean, one that can supply anything?
2008-11-03 20:28 Cale             Well, in this specific example, I mean one which can supply integers.

2008-11-03 20:30 mmorrow          Cale: one thing i've thought about doing is having a function which takes some appropriate "specification" for a needed monad (e.g. i want get, tell, callCC, and local, but i also want get to do ..) and which then constructs the flattened and fully optimized data/newtype decls, instances of Functor and Monad, the requested helper functions, and a run<name-of-monad> function with template-haskell (it just happens that TH is (probably)
2008-11-03 20:30 mmorrow          the most convenient way to construct this, but it's not essential to the problem in any way)
2008-11-03 20:30 pozic            Is there a way to write this without explicit recursion? http://paste.debian.net/20574/
2008-11-03 20:31 mmorrow          Cale: so any example of a flattened composite monad would be RWS

2008-11-03 21:07 EvilTerran       runs the side-effects of x before those of f, which is why it's not exactly flip (<*>)

2008-11-03 21:12 quicksilver      note the subtle difference between liftA2 (flip ($)) and flip (liftA2 ($))
2008-11-03 21:13 quicksilver      so <**> is not just flip (<*>)
2008-11-03 21:13 ben_h            holy crap

2008-11-03 21:14 ben_h            the thing i like most about this so far is how directly it maps to pure mathematics
2008-11-03 21:14 ben_h            having studied it a bit at uni
2008-11-03 21:14 EvilTerran       > [(x,y) | x <- [1,2,3], y <- [4,5,6], even (x+y)]

2008-11-03 21:14 EvilTerran       ben_h, indeed, haskell is *very* maths-y compared to most programming languages
2008-11-03 21:14 ben_h            C functions shouldn't really be called functions imo, they should be called methods as is convention in ruby
2008-11-03 21:14 EvilTerran       i'd be tempted to say it's more like maths than it is like conventional programming
2008-11-03 21:14 ben_h            hmm
2008-11-03 21:15 ben_h            sounds reasonable from the bits i've seen so far
2008-11-03 21:15 bitrot`          /join 
2008-11-03 21:15 EvilTerran       ben_h, ah, C functions are still functions, they just implicitly take the universe as a parameter and return a new one :P
2008-11-03 21:15 ben_h            lol
2008-11-03 21:15 EvilTerran       (this is actually remarkably similar to how GHC models IO and whatnot under-the-hood)

2008-11-03 21:16 ben_h            i dunno, i like to think of a function as a mapping between this and that, or like a graph - not a list of 'do this, then do this, then do this'
2008-11-03 21:16 EvilTerran       ben_h, as i say, "do this" can be read as "look at the universe parameter, and make a new one based on that but with these changes"
2008-11-03 21:16 ben_h            haha
2008-11-03 21:16 rob|             /join 
2008-11-03 21:17 ben_h            so there's not really much scope-related stuff in haskell?
2008-11-03 21:17 Deewiant         what do you mean?
2008-11-03 21:17 EvilTerran       i actually find this a useful idea to keep in mind when thinking about side-effects
2008-11-03 21:17 EvilTerran       when you get to looking at the State monad, you'll see that's pretty much exactly how it gives the impression of mutable state
2008-11-03 21:17 ben_h            is it true that the only data a function has access to is its params?
2008-11-03 21:17 ben_h            a pure function that is
2008-11-03 21:18 EvilTerran       well, its params, and anything in a lexically enclosing scope of its definition
2008-11-03 21:18 ben_h            i.e. other functions?
2008-11-03 21:18 Saizan           other functions or constants

2008-11-03 21:20 ben_h            i'm a little slower than lambdabot ;)
2008-11-03 21:20 EvilTerran       ben_h, it sounds really complicated, but i find it basically boils down to "if (and only if) it looks in the source code like it should be in scope, it probably is"

2008-11-03 21:23 EvilTerran       Beelsebob / Deewiant, well, for a while, \bot would splice "> ..."s into "let v = (...) in v" for some reason
2008-11-03 21:24 EvilTerran       someone noticed this somehow, and started writing expressions in terms of this v

2008-11-03 21:24 ben_h            i.e. are there situations where the syntax would otherwise be ambiguous?
2008-11-03 21:24 quicksilver      no.
2008-11-03 21:25 Beelsebob        ben_h: the syntactic sugar is a disadvantage, not advantage ;
2008-11-03 21:25 quicksilver      but they do allow you to put code on one line
2008-11-03 21:25 Beelsebob        ;
2008-11-03 21:25 Beelsebob        ;)
2008-11-03 21:25 quicksilver      which is handy for lambdabot
2008-11-03 21:25 EvilTerran       ben_h, no, not really, unless you're cramming everything on one line
2008-11-03 21:25 ben_h            ahh yep
2008-11-03 21:25 ben_h            multiline it's clear enough anyway
2008-11-03 21:25 EvilTerran       Deewiant / Beelsebob: anyway, this was temporarily fixed for a while, until someone noticed the variable had just been renamed to yhjulwwiefzojcbxybbruweejw
2008-11-03 21:25 Deewiant         LOL
2008-11-03 21:25 Deewiant         what a fix
2008-11-03 21:25 EvilTerran       now it uses a random three-letter name, iirc
2008-11-03 21:26 Deewiant         aha
2008-11-03 21:26 Deewiant         so if I keep writing everything as 'let aaa = ... in aaa' I'll get an error one day?

2008-11-06 01:02 p_l              jmelesky: I think it's more stagnant cause no-one is willing to do anything about the spec (no one with enough resources)
2008-11-06 01:02 Baughn           jmelesky: It might have some interesting ideas, but the syntax makes me recoil in horror

2008-11-06 01:03 jmelesky         p_l: well, yeah, but the high resource requirement is in large part due to the size and complexity of the spec (compare, say the RxRS process for Scheme)

2008-11-06 01:03 jmelesky         Baughn: didn't an earlier Haskell have generalized monad cmoprehensions?
2008-11-06 01:03 p_l              jmelesky: With Scheme you could probably only add features... I mean, wasn't the original spec below 30 pages?
2008-11-06 01:03 Cale             Baughn: I've often wondered how it might look to combine the two extensions in a compatible way.
2008-11-06 01:03 vixey            mc__, you can replace the view pattern with a case expression
2008-11-06 01:04 luite            Cale: no, not yet at least ;) so I guess I can also use a binary, but I still think I should be able to compile it :)

2008-11-06 01:04 Baughn           jmelesky: Yeah, but that implementation turned out to be a bad idea due to mixing it up with the syntax for creating lists
2008-11-06 01:04 Baughn           jmelesky: Though I don't particularily agree with removing it, still
2008-11-06 01:04 luite            Baughn: no, just ran ./configure --prefix=/my/custom/install/location and then make

2008-11-06 01:04 BMeph_           I don't understand how bad the performance issue is for the SQL-like comp, w/o compiler support. Does anyone here know?
2008-11-06 01:04 jmelesky         p_l: yeah, the spec was and is tiny, especially compared to its big brother Common Lisp (the old joke was that the Scheme spec was smaller than the *index* for the CL spec)
2008-11-06 01:04 Baughn           Cale: Or you're on OS X, where it's the only way to get one that works properly.
2008-11-06 01:05 yitz             Baughn: well those of us on Tiger, or ppc, or both.

2008-11-06 01:05 p_l              jmelesky: Though I have to say, 99% of complains about CL spec I hear from people hacking on CL, is about things that aren't there

2008-11-06 01:08 p_l              jmelesky: Also, CL lacks one "main" (like CPython, MS version of .NET, Sun's JVM) or "leading" implementation (like GHC). Also, it's age means people think there weren't any changes

2008-11-06 01:13 Baughn           yitz: It may be impossible to support. Haskell moves fast; debian.. doesn't.
2008-11-06 01:14 pizza_           newbie here. trying to learn haskell by writing a hastable (i knoew Data.HashTable exists). i'm not sure if my code even ultimately works, but i'm getting a strange inconsistency where one call to (f x) complains about the type of x, but the exact same call on the next line compiles fine. http://hpaste.org/11754#a2
2008-11-06 01:14 Baughn           When they won't package anything newer than two years, and most haskell programs probably won't work with 6.8 soon enough, what can you do?
2008-11-06 01:14 yitz             Baughn: no problem to support. If I can compile it, why can't there be a backport, or at least a binary download?
2008-11-06 01:14 Cale             jmelesky: While this is true to an extent (a lot of things only work using GHC with extensions), the extensions are in most cases very well documented, and it's silly to try to standardise things which haven't been implemented and tried.
2008-11-06 01:14 Baughn           yitz: Oh, there could be /that/. I've got one
2008-11-06 01:15 yitz             Baughn: right, and that's correct policy. Debian stable rocks for a production environment.
2008-11-06 01:15 p_l              Baughn: I think it's not that hard to support Debian stable. Of course unless you use some libraries that clash with what is included in Debian stable
2008-11-06 01:15 Cale             pizza_: okay I'll have a look. I should also point out though that Data.HashTable is garbage and you should never ever use it.
2008-11-06 01:15 p_l              on the other hand, sid is dancing on blade's edge
2008-11-06 01:15 Baughn           p_l: That does make the download a bit larger, but it's not too hard if you install in /opt/ghc
2008-11-06 01:15 Cale             pizza_: Data.Map is pure, much faster, and scales better.
2008-11-06 01:15 jmelesky         Cale: yeah, i guess i just wish that the development effort either was entirely towards GHC, or more evenly spread out over the different compilers
2008-11-06 01:15 Cale             (and doesn't involve hashing)

2008-11-06 01:17 jpcooper         is Data.map.lookup implemented in standard Haskell 98? I'm wondering how it manages to do the returning of polymorphic monadic values

2008-11-08 22:44 dcoutts          ManateeLazyCat: my guess is that your X11 Haskell package is registered but that the files got deleted for some reason
2008-11-08 22:45 dcoutts          so cabal thinks X11 is installed, but when it comes to compile then ghc cannot find the files
2008-11-08 22:45 dcoutts          ManateeLazyCat: if you want to confirm that theory, use ghc-pkg describe X11 and look in the import-dirs for the .hi files corresponding to the module `Graphics.X11.Xlib.Extras'

2008-11-08 22:52 dcoutts          ManateeLazyCat: the fix would be to cabal install x11 --reinstall

2008-11-08 23:00 FunctorSalad_    does anyone else sometimes find themselves writing lots of functions of the form gazonk2qux where Gazonk and Qux are some specialized types in your program, and this is the only function of that type?
2008-11-08 23:00 FunctorSalad_    I'm wondering whether there is some abstraction lurking there
2008-11-08 23:00 dcoutts          ManateeLazyCat: that would wipe everything clean. (apart from global packages, but those will be ok)
2008-11-08 23:01 dcoutts          FunctorSalad_: not necessarily, you'd expect that kind of thing in a functional program.
2008-11-08 23:01 FunctorSalad_    (of course, there's class Convertible a b where convert :: a -> b)
2008-11-08 23:01 dcoutts          FunctorSalad_: which is just.... a function!
2008-11-08 23:01 FunctorSalad_    :)
2008-11-08 23:01 dcoutts          it doesn't really tell you much about the relationship of the types beyond there being a function between them
2008-11-08 23:01 dcoutts          and overloading that name is probably not of huge benefit
2008-11-08 23:03 dcoutts          FunctorSalad_: if there was a more specialised relationship then there's more of an argument, eg if there's a total injection and partial-projection, ie an embedding between the types

2008-11-08 23:05 FunctorSalad_    dcoutts: another specialization would be that any conversion path from a to b must be the same function
2008-11-08 23:06 dcoutts          FunctorSalad_: yes
2008-11-08 23:06 dcoutts          FunctorSalad_: eg we've got a class like that in our QC tests for strict and lazy bytestring, since there's that kind of relationship between String, strict ByteStrign and lazy ByteString
2008-11-08 23:06 dcoutts          it lets us write some of the properties in a more generic fashion
2008-11-08 23:13 mattam           FunctorSalad_: It's called coercive subtyping in type theory and has been extensively studied. It's at the basis of dealing with hierarchies of structures in Coq.
2008-11-08 23:14 mattam           The conditions on the coercions are generaly called coherence conditions and most of the time are undecidable :)

2008-11-08 23:15 FunctorSalad_    sure, in haskell we already ask the programmer to check other undecidable laws manually
2008-11-08 23:15 mattam           Indeed.

2008-11-08 23:17 mattam           It's sufficiently nice that you can have coercions to "function class" for example, automatically coercion an object of record type to a function (by taking some projection) or a type.

2008-11-08 23:31 Beelsebob        I'm writing a program for generating cross stitch patterns from images

2008-11-08 23:35 Beelsebob        pozic: because usually your colour table contains fewer colours than the image does
2008-11-08 23:35 Beelsebob        in this case, it's also likely that some of the colours in the image have no thread that exactly matches
2008-11-08 23:35 kuribas          Beelsebob: You mean quantization?
2008-11-08 23:36 Beelsebob        kuribas: I can already do the quantization part -- what I'm not sure of how to do is generating a "good" set of colours to put in the table
2008-11-08 23:36 Beelsebob        i.e. if I have an image of a fire, it's a bad idea to fill the colour table with blacks, and greens
2008-11-08 23:37 Beelsebob        but instead to say "hey, buy a bunch of red, yellow and orange thread"
2008-11-08 23:37 kuribas          Hm, I thought that's what quantization is about.
2008-11-08 23:37 Beelsebob        oh, I thought quantization was the step where you said "hey, I have this discrete set, how do I get these values to fit it"
2008-11-08 23:37 Beelsebob        rather than generating the discrete set

I have a list of vectors. how better to represent those vectors from the point of view of efficiency, readability, availability of standard library functions etc. as list or as tuple? the length and type of vector is fixed i.e. float, float, float. what do you think? if length is fixed seems logical to use tuples, but type is the same for each component so list is better...

2008-11-08 23:40 ksf              look at how the gl bindings do it, too.
2008-11-08 23:40 Beelsebob        I think a few people have done that over the past few days
2008-11-08 23:41 ksf              something like data = Vec3d !Double !Double !Double
2008-11-08 23:41 paczesiowa       or many people with fundeps over past few years
2008-11-08 23:41 hoknamahn        arhh I did it :)
2008-11-08 23:42 hoknamahn        I'm just wondering what is better - list or tuple. when to use list when better to use tuple
2008-11-08 23:42 Beelsebob        hoknamahn: you *may* also just want to grab the vector-sapce package
2008-11-08 23:42 Beelsebob        :D
2008-11-08 23:42 Beelsebob        which deals with this for you
2008-11-08 23:42 hoknamahn        noooo... :D
2008-11-08 23:42 ksf              note the !'s to unbox the Doubles, if you're using -funbox-strict-fields, too, you won't have any doubles outside of registers.
2008-11-08 23:42 hoknamahn        i did it as
2008-11-08 23:43 hoknamahn        data Vector3 = V3 !Scalar !Scalar !Scalar
2008-11-08 23:43 hoknamahn        so my question is a bit different

2008-11-08 23:43 hoknamahn        when tuples and when lists
2008-11-08 23:43 hoknamahn        in the situation when we have same types and length
2008-11-08 23:43 paczesiowa       lists when you don't know lenght until runtime
2008-11-08 23:43 hoknamahn        like float float or int int
2008-11-08 23:44 hoknamahn        so if I know the length tuples are better anyway?
2008-11-08 23:44 paczesiowa       using (a,a) type system takes care of empty lists
2008-11-08 23:44 paczesiowa       it sure is safer - I call it better
2008-11-08 23:45 paczesiowa       and with those unboxed fields it will be faster
2008-11-08 23:45 Beelsebob        strictifying things isn't always faster
2008-11-08 23:45 Beelsebob        in fact, it's often slower
2008-11-08 23:45 Beelsebob        it will certainly consume less ram though

2008-11-08 23:47 Beelsebob        it's a good entry point to hat-anim (you can use :a to animate one of the reductions)

2008-11-08 23:49 paczesiowa       hoknamahn: using tuples you don't loose functions like map or fold
2008-11-08 23:49 Beelsebob        aeolist: well, you can also just call hat-anim on the whole program, but you tend to get "hey, some IO happened"

2008-11-09 21:27 Deewiant         x86-64/x64 are more usually terms that refer to both AMD64 and IA64

2008-11-09 21:27 luite            x86-64 doesn't refer to ia64
2008-11-09 21:27 Deewiant         what's the core architecture
2008-11-09 21:27 Deewiant         yeah
2008-11-09 21:27 luite            ia64 is only used for high end servers :)
2008-11-09 21:27 Deewiant         IA64 refers specifically to the itanium, which isn't x86
2008-11-09 21:27 mmorrow          just invoked the googlemachine

2008-11-09 21:27 pozic            x64 is a marketing term from MS.
2008-11-09 21:28 Deewiant         evidently it's been renamed to Intel 64
2008-11-09 21:28 byorgey          hi dermiste
2008-11-09 21:28 Deewiant         so we have AMD64 and Intel 64, which are both commonly referred to as x86-64, and x64 is an MS term for x86-64. :-)
2008-11-09 21:28 pozic            Deewiant: right
2008-11-09 21:28 pozic            Deewiant: I am not sure about the Intel 64.
2008-11-09 21:28 Deewiant         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x86-64#Intel_64
2008-11-09 21:29 pozic            Deewiant: yes, I also checked.
2008-11-09 21:29 Deewiant         I think there are some differences between AMD64 and Intel 64 and the original x86-64 spec.

2008-11-09 21:33 ksf              iirc x86_64 was coined by people who wanted to be politically correct in their #defines as intel started to offer amd64-compatible cpus.

2008-11-09 21:33 Deewiant         x86-64 was the original spec for 64-bit x86 machines

2008-11-09 22:05 luite            so I don't have lists of Int, but of a tuple, but that's just a minor difference :)
2008-11-09 22:05 EvilTerran       well, that'll mean succ won't work

2008-11-09 22:06 EvilTerran       so how are you deciding how many []s should between any two particular elements?
2008-11-09 22:08 mmorrow          i think this file has both Linker.c and the mangler beat (maybe) http://moonpatio.com/repos/glibc-2.7/elf/tls-macros.h
2008-11-09 22:08 mmorrow          i vomitted a little in my mouth when i opened that file :)
2008-11-09 22:09 mmorrow          thought i'd share it with the channel
2008-11-09 22:09 EvilTerran       gee thanks -.-
2008-11-09 22:09 luite            EvilTerran: depends on the direction :)   each arc is (parent,child), when adding the outgoing arcs, the list is sorted on fst, for example [(0,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,7)], this should result in [[4],[],[],[5,6],[7]]

2008-11-09 22:10 luite            the gap size is the gap between the 'fst' of adjacent elements in the list

2008-11-09 22:10 EvilTerran       and then you're throwing away the fsts?
2008-11-09 22:10 luite            yes
2008-11-09 22:11 EvilTerran       do you want to always start from 0, then?

2008-11-09 22:12 Deewiant         easy enough to fix :-P
2008-11-09 22:14 luite            I think go i [] = [] should be = repeat []
2008-11-09 22:14 Deewiant         so from 0 to infinity?
2008-11-09 22:14 luite            at least for my application :)
2008-11-09 22:14 Deewiant         why not negative infinity to infinity? ;-)
2008-11-09 22:14 luite            yes, there may be no arcs to or from the last nodes
2008-11-09 22:14 jpcooper         /join 
2008-11-09 22:15 luite            and then I can zip with a list of nodes, and always have enough elements in my incoming-arcs-for-each-node-list :)
2008-11-09 22:15 Deewiant         repeat [] ++ ... ++ repeat [] :-)

2008-11-09 22:22 JuanDaugherty    6.10 is not the "best", in the sense of most stable and most likely to work with existing packages, is it?
2008-11-09 22:23 mmorrow          JuanDaugherty: what do you mean by "stable"?
2008-11-09 22:23 luite            I think 6.8.3 is more likely to work with existing packages
2008-11-09 22:23 JuanDaugherty    luite, thanks!
2008-11-09 22:23 Deewiant         there are some packages that only work with any one of 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 6.10 out there...
2008-11-09 22:23 luite            but those should probably be fixed :)
2008-11-09 22:24 mmorrow          then again, all packages will be being made to work with 6.10 in the near future
2008-11-09 22:24 Deewiant         for small values of 'all' ;-)
2008-11-09 22:24 luite            I'd use 6.10 unless you need some specific package that is not yet updated
2008-11-09 22:24 JuanDaugherty    <- lives in the past and present.
2008-11-09 22:24 mmorrow          i think only the stragglers are not 6.10-ready :)
2008-11-09 22:24 RayNbow          luite, do you still need that function to do that vertices stuff?

2008-11-09 22:25 JuanDaugherty    luite, why is that?
2008-11-09 22:25 EvilTerran       would it be wise to uninstall 6.8.2 before installing 6.10?
2008-11-09 22:25 mmorrow          JuanDaugherty: well, because 6.10 is a better compiler.
2008-11-09 22:25 mmorrow          which produces better code :)
2008-11-09 22:25 JuanDaugherty    in what sense?
2008-11-09 22:26 EvilTerran       /action is slightly wary about throwing one install over the top of another one and praying it works
2008-11-09 22:26 tomh             /join 
2008-11-09 22:26 JuanDaugherty    i'd prolly use 6.10 for dev, 6.8.3 for prod, if that's a distinction that can penetrate in this space.

2008-11-11 09:22 jsn              run meaningful joins requires you to ship indices all across the cluster, too

2008-11-11 09:31 ddarius          roconnor: Actually, for an unnormalized vector, the magnitude should cancel out when doing the versor product.
2008-11-11 09:31 ben_h            gwern: i thought glib and gtk were different libs?

2008-11-11 09:31 roconnor         ddarius: should anisotropic scales take a bivector or a vecotor, or shoudl there be versions taking both?

2008-11-11 09:33 ddarius          roconnor: Anisotropic scaling doesn't map to a nice GA operation.  It's best represented as a linear transformation.
2008-11-11 09:33 askentasken      OK so what are the conditions that must be met to make it possible?

2008-11-11 09:33 roconnor         ddarius: GA operations preserve the inner product?
2008-11-11 09:34 gwern            jsn: now, I'm unsure Data.List, say, is a full replacement for sed, but that's largely because I'm unsure of the full scope of sed - I never really learned it beyond the most simple replacement stuff
2008-11-11 09:34 loop_            sed is turing-complete :)
2008-11-11 09:34 ddarius          roconnor: Isotropic scaling (i.e. multiplying by a constant) doesn't preserve inner products (unless you meant up to scaling)
2008-11-11 09:34 roconnor         I guess I mean upto scaling
2008-11-11 09:35 jsn              gwern: if we exclude file reading and writing, sed basically is a parser with a little stack you can push lines on to to use as an alternate input source
2008-11-11 09:35 roconnor         strange that uniform scaling in 3d had det -1, but in 2d all the operations have positive determinant.
2008-11-11 09:35 jsn              (the "hold" buffer, which few people learn)
2008-11-11 09:36 jsn              this is straightforward to model in haskell, of course -- and can be treated as pure, even
2008-11-11 09:37 gwern            would the stack be done by a state monad? or is it a purely functional data structure?
2008-11-11 09:37 jsn              state monad
2008-11-11 09:37 jsn              yeah

2008-11-11 09:37 jsn              each operation in sed receives the output of a prior operation
2008-11-11 09:38 jsn              you can imagine that newline in sed is the same thing as '|' in the shell
2008-11-11 09:39 ddarius          roconnor: Personally, I'd represent anisotropic scaling as a linear transformation created from <dimension> numbers.  I would not use a vector, and definitely not a bivector, for it.
2008-11-11 09:39 jsn              so    /^foo/ ! d  ;   s/$/ bar/'    reads, delete all lines that have begin not with 'foo', then for all these lines, replace the end with ' bar'
2008-11-11 09:39 roconnor         ddarius: nah, you wouldn't do that.  You want it to be coordinate independent.
2008-11-11 09:39 jsn              sorry, extraneous quote

2008-11-11 09:41 ddarius          roconnor: Using a vector in this instance doesn't make things any less coordinate independent, unless you are using it in a clever way that I'm not thinking of.
2008-11-11 09:41 roconnor         ddarius: I think I'd use both, but I'd scale by the reciprocol of the magnitude of the bivector.
2008-11-11 09:41 jsn              gwern: the shell is a terrible language in many ways
2008-11-11 09:41 gwern            and yet, we're stuck with it
2008-11-11 09:41 ddarius          roconnor: Really, you want the user to provide the linear transformation.  The linear transformation itself isn't coordinate dependent.
2008-11-11 09:41 jsn              gwern: but it makes certain things really convenient
2008-11-11 09:42 roconnor         ddarius: possibly. rotate until the vector is pointing along the x axis, scale on the x axis, rotate back.

2008-11-11 09:42 roconnor         ddarius: the artist doesn't want to give arbitrary linear transformation.  They want to use a specific set of transformations they understand.
2008-11-11 09:42 jsn              gwern: i don't think HSH is an acceptable substitute, in consequence
2008-11-11 09:43 ddarius          roconnor: I understand that you wouldn't want to have to give a linear transformation in this case.
2008-11-11 09:43 jsn              /action turns his mind to the evils of piping between processes
2008-11-11 09:44 ddarius          roconnor: (Though I'd say most artists would be quite happy with a coordinate dependent anisotropic scale.  Just let them also be able to choose and change the basis vectors.)
2008-11-11 09:44 ddarius          (Actually, if they can arbitrarily change the basis vectors, there's no need for an anisotropic scale, albeit this is just dressing a linear transformation up differently.)

2008-11-11 09:55 dons             snk_kid: awesome.

2008-11-11 09:55 ddarius          roconnor: Here's the heart of the matter: how do you simply and naturally specify an orthogonal basis?

2008-11-11 09:56 roconnor         ddarius: when doing an anisotropic transformation with two eigenvalues equal to 1, you only need to specify one element of the basis.

2008-11-11 09:57 roconnor         the only question is, should this basis be specified by a vector, or a bivector?
2008-11-11 09:57 jeffz            dons, on windows and while testing things in Wine.
2008-11-11 09:58 ddarius          roconnor: In my opinion, the question is becoming: is anisotropic scaling a convenient operation.
2008-11-11 09:58 roconnor         ddarius: I'm leaning towards a bivector because what you are really specifying is a fixed plane, and a magnitued.
2008-11-11 09:58 roconnor         ddarius: yes it is a convenient operation

2008-11-11 10:04 roconnor         ddarius: a fixed hyperplane
2008-11-11 10:04 ksf              did a world update for the first time in a year and only had to resolve a single block.
2008-11-11 10:04 ddarius          roconnor: Ah, yes silly me.
2008-11-11 10:04 ksf              which was kinda trivial.
2008-11-11 10:04 ddarius          So for 3D you want a bivector, but in general you want a 1-covector.
2008-11-11 10:05 Cale             IsoPallo_: There's a paper on LogicT which you might want to read.

2008-11-11 10:06 Cale             IsoPallo_: Well... that would be a good idea, but I don't know of much.
2008-11-11 10:06 gwern            Cale: they're not worth it, unless you want to try a nextgen source distro like NixOS
2008-11-11 10:06 gwern            er. I meant cads
2008-11-11 10:07 ddarius          roconnor: Okay, so we pass in a (unnormalized) normal vector representing the fixed plane and it's magnitude.

2008-11-11 10:09 Axman6           i think the problem may be that mmap takes an int for the size of the region you want to allocate
2008-11-11 10:10 Axman6           so, that limits it to 4GB or less on a 32 bit system
2008-11-11 10:10 Axman6           i could very easily be wrong though
2008-11-11 10:10 gwern            that's pretty much what I thought as well, although I wasn't sure it was the mmap calls

2008-11-11 10:29 glguy            cads, right, debian is an example of a more inclusive repo

2008-11-11 10:43 ddarius          Clifford called it Geometric Algebra and that name seems very appropriate.  Also, nowadays "Clifford Algebra" scares up notions of QM.
2008-11-11 10:44 roconnor         CliffordAlgebra have more operations that Geometric Algebra.
2008-11-11 10:45 roconnor         You can add arbitrary elements in a CliffordAlgebra.  Where Geometric Algebra is restricted to (mostly?) blades.

2008-11-11 16:11 Cale             Which is something inherently unsafe due to, for instance, compiler optimisations that operate under the assumption that functions are pure.

2008-11-11 16:12 Cale             To be fair, you can actually use unsafePerformIO to do some pretty neat things if you know what you're doing, but if you're just doing normal IO, that's what the IO monad is for.
2008-11-11 16:13 x6d65            Twey: "Nevertheless, when the proof obligations are satisﬁed, unsafePerformIO can be extremely useful. In practice, I have encountered three very common patterns of usage:"

2008-11-11 16:15 luqui            So my guess is that it is not safe to marshall a TypeRep.  What, then, would be a safe way to write typesafe marshalling?  Something from Data.Generics?
2008-11-11 16:15 Cale             x6d65: One appropriate use of unsafePerformIO is to write memoising functions. Most others have to do with FFI -- making calls to a C library to compute something which you know is going to be pure, but requires some otherwise-ignorable I/O.
2008-11-11 16:15 luqui            i.e. I want to write the Binary form of a value along with its type, so I can make sure it's the type I'm expecting before reading it back in
2008-11-11 16:16 luqui            If this has already been done, I'd love to see it
2008-11-11 16:16 pumpkin_         Cale: are there other less scary-sounding ways to memoize?
2008-11-11 16:16 pumpkin_         I guess memoization isn't naturally very functional
2008-11-11 16:16 dolio            Yes, there are.
2008-11-11 16:16 luqui            pumpkin_, data-memocombinators  (shameless plug)
2008-11-11 16:16 Cale             pumpkin_: Well, someone really should write a library. It's quite possible to write a function  memo :: (Ord a) => (a -> b) -> (a -> b)
2008-11-11 16:16 Cale             aha
2008-11-11 16:17 pumpkin_         ah
2008-11-11 16:17 pumpkin_         that uses a map internally to remember it?

2008-11-11 18:31 dolio            Yeah. I assume it's the same bug, since the new haddock just hooks into GHC's api somehow.
2008-11-11 18:31 dolio            If you type in ":t (>>>) :: Arrow (~>) => (a ~> b) -> (b ~> c) -> (a ~> c)" in ghci, you should see the same sort of weird behavior.
2008-11-11 18:32 dolio            All the ~> are treated as prefix in the output.
2008-11-11 18:32 Peaker           arrg,  hoogle takes --convert=BLAH, but not hoogle --convert BLAH, and the shell doesn't expand wildcards when its prefixed with --convert=
2008-11-11 18:33 Peaker           --convert=$(echo ...wildcards...) works though

2008-11-11 20:08 Stalin           the problem is, I don't really know how to define the main function so that I could use all the other functions in the program

2008-11-11 20:09 ToRA|MSR         main = print other_function
2008-11-11 20:09 ToRA|MSR         would be a really simple starting point
2008-11-11 20:09 Stalin           is it possible to have my program wait for the user input, so that it acts similar to what it would do in interactive mode?
2008-11-11 20:10 Thomas2          you know you can use your program from interactive mode?
2008-11-11 20:10 Stalin           yes, but I want it compiled
2008-11-11 20:10 Feuerbach        /join 
2008-11-11 20:10 ToRA|MSR         you can also compile your program and then load it in ghci
2008-11-11 20:11 Thomas2          sure. putting a lot of work into replicating interactive mode doesn't make a lot of sense though
2008-11-11 20:11 Thomas2          so can anyone tell me what the cool kids are using to make slides these days?
2008-11-11 20:11 Stalin           but what if, say, I want to use it on a different computer and don't want to download the whole interpreter?
2008-11-11 20:11 Peaker           Beelsebob_: you there?
2008-11-11 20:12 Thomas2          then I guess replicating interactive mode might make more sense
2008-11-11 20:12 rog              quick question: is there a simple class constraint on f that would allow me to write a fn with type: Monad m => f (m a) -> m (f a) ?
2008-11-11 20:12 Axman6           Thomas2: LaTeX Beamer class, or Keynote >_>
2008-11-11 20:12 Stalin           in C++ "interactive" mode would just be an infinite loop with checking the input, is something like that possible in a comparable amount of effort in Haskell?
2008-11-11 20:12 Axman6           Stalin: you could have a readLine loop...

2008-11-11 20:31 Stalin           I'm still having problems with getting my program to work and quite honestly don't understand the negative attitude towards side effects
2008-11-11 20:32 Axman6           it's a lot harder to guarantee a lot of stuff there's sideeffects
2008-11-11 20:32 Stalin           I mean, they seriously made interactive programs easier to write and almost every piece of software is interactive
2008-11-11 20:33 Beelsebob_       Stalin: the negative attitude towards side effects is caused by them disallowing things like parallelism

The trouble is that the int argument is a flag indicating which element of the union that is PAPI_option_t should be read.  On top of that sometimes fields of PAPI_option_t are for input and sometimes they are just for output.  I know how to do the low level FFI, but I'm uncertain how to design the high level Haskell interface (e.g. what type 
2008-11-11 20:42 mdmkolbe           I see two possibilities.  I could make separate functions for each flag (e.g. getOptPreload, getOptMaxCpus, etc.) each with their own type appropriate to the flag.  Or I could maybe have one function with a GADT argument (e.g. getOpt :: GetOptArg a -> IO (GetOptResult a)).  I'm sort of on the fence here so does anyone have opinions, suggestions or experiences that might help me figure this out?

2008-11-11 20:57 quicksilver      the essence of lazy process is recognition that you might generate an IO error later.
2008-11-11 20:57 quicksilver      so String is the wrong type
2008-11-11 20:57 quicksilver      a line based example might be

2008-11-11 21:11 mdmkolbe         I have a C function (PAPI_get_opt(int,PAPI_option_t*)) that I am trying to build a Haskell binding for.  The trouble is that the int argument is a flag indicating which element of the union that is PAPI_option_t should be read.  On top of that sometimes fields of PAPI_option_t are for input and sometimes they are just for output.  I know how to do the low level FFI, but I'm uncertain how to design the high level Haskell interface (e.g. what type 
2008-11-11 21:11 vixey            = zipWith ((+)`on`ord) codetable plaintext
2008-11-11 21:11 Beelsebob_       you want something along the lines of runCommand ("simpleCyp":key:plaintext:[]) = simpleCype parameters
2008-11-11 21:11 mdmkolbe           I see two possibilities.  I could make separate functions for each flag (e.g. getOptPreload, getOptMaxCpus, etc.) each with their own type appropriate to the flag.  Or I could maybe have one function with a GADT argument (e.g. getOpt :: GetOptArg a -> IO (GetOptResult a)).  I'm sort of on the fence here so does anyone have opinions, suggestions or experiences that might help me figure this out?

2008-11-11 21:14 Beelsebob_       it's outputting a list of ints
2008-11-11 21:14 ksf              mdmkolbe, you could do two Data.Sets, one called Settable and one Gettable, and make two functions, one that sets the set and one that gets it.

2008-11-11 21:21 ksf              I'm mainly suggesting this because a union perfectly maps onto a GADT and using a GADT for it doesn't seem very haskellish, I wouldn't want to use it from the Haskell side. Then, just typing down the GADT and some TH seems to be the most efficient way of implementing the high-level interface.

2008-11-11 21:28 Stalin           in GHCi I would just go simpleCyp "key" "words to encrypt"

2008-11-11 21:29 Stalin           it just feels like I'm placing a hack on a hack on a hack instead of using the language like it's supposed to be used
2008-11-11 21:30 Beelsebob_       Stalin: well -- what would you do the imperative way
2008-11-11 21:30 ksf              I wouldn't count that as a vote in favour of GADT style
2008-11-11 21:30 Beelsebob_       you'd loop until you got a space
2008-11-11 21:30 Beelsebob_       then you'd consume all the spaces
2008-11-11 21:30 Beelsebob_       then you'd check you got a quote

2008-11-11 21:30 Axman6           that's pretty hacky
2008-11-11 21:30 Beelsebob_       then you'd consume everything until the next quote
2008-11-11 21:30 Beelsebob_       etc
2008-11-11 21:30 Beelsebob_       which as Axman6 says, is nasty and hacky
2008-11-11 21:30 Beelsebob_       so with something like parsec, you can parse this really quickly and elegantly in Haskell
2008-11-11 21:31 ksf              Always use parsec if you can.

2008-11-11 21:31 Beelsebob_       or, you could hack it, by using let (cmd, (key, plaintext)) = second (break isSpace) (break isSpace xs)
2008-11-11 21:32 Beelsebob_       but parsec would be a lot neater
2008-11-11 21:32 Axman6           usong something like 'f ("encrypt":key:message) = enc key $ concat message is pretty clear to me
2008-11-11 21:32 vixey            mdmkolbe: I am recommending against using TH

2008-11-12 08:37 FunctorSalad_    what then? "would be the result of currying if it hadn't been born curried?"?
2008-11-12 08:37 mdmkolbe         mm_freak: yeah, that universal doesn't work (peeks are legal), but I'm sure the existential version would work.  thanks for the help
2008-11-12 08:38 mm_freak         mdmkolbe: that's the same trick ST uses to allow safe threading of the state
2008-11-12 08:39 mdmkolbe         /action just realize existeantials won't work either (they require an extra constructor around the Ptr)

2008-11-12 08:40 FunctorSalad_    mm_freak / mdmkolbe : I'm not familiar with the ffi but what's the difficulty with void* ?
2008-11-12 08:40 FunctorSalad_    just curious
2008-11-12 08:40 mm_freak         FunctorSalad_: he want's peek/poke not to work on void pointers
2008-11-12 08:40 mdmkolbe         mm_freak: the only way to write an existential is "data Foo = Foo (forall a. Ptr a)" <- note the "Foo" constructor around everything
2008-11-12 08:41 mdmkolbe         FunctorSalad_: what mm_freak said
2008-11-12 08:41 FunctorSalad_    :)
2008-11-12 08:41 Lemmih           mm_freak: Why is that a problem?
2008-11-12 08:41 mdmkolbe         FunctorSalad_: this is because "*(void*)x" is a type error in C.  You always have to cast away from (void*) before dereferencing
2008-11-12 08:41 mm_freak         mdmkolbe: getSomePointer :: IO (forall a. Ptr a)
2008-11-12 08:42 Lemmih           mdmkolbe: You have to do the same thing in Haskell.
2008-11-12 08:42 mdmkolbe         FunctorSalad_: thus I would like the same constraint imposed on the Haskell type
2008-11-12 08:42 FunctorSalad_    does the haskell translation have to be a Ptr something?
2008-11-12 08:42 mm_freak         Lemmih: i don't know, but probably it's a pointer to some opaque structure

2008-11-12 08:44 mfwitten         Well, there was an interesting 6.8.3 binary distribution for Mac OS X PPC that allowed me to configure the destination for installation. With this, I have been able to start building GHC 6.10.

2008-11-12 08:44 FunctorSalad_    Ptr AnyCastable, AnyCastable an existential castable?
2008-11-12 08:45 Lemmih           mdmkolbe: "peek (ptr :: Ptr ())" is a type error in Haskell. You always have to cast away from 'Ptr ()' before dereferencing.
2008-11-12 08:45 mm_freak         Lemmih: unless there is some hidden Storable instance for ()
2008-11-12 08:45 Will\home        /join 
2008-11-12 08:45 mm_freak         that's his concern
2008-11-12 08:46 Lemmih           mm_freak: There is no. There cannot be a sensible instance for ().
2008-11-12 08:46 mofmog           I thought () was everything and nothing
2008-11-12 08:46 mm_freak         why not?  it's just that it would always poke and peek the same value
2008-11-12 08:47 Lemmih           mm_freak: Exactly. They wouldn't touch the ptr at all. No dereferencing takes place.
2008-11-12 08:47 dolio            'data Foo = Foo (forall a. Ptr a)' is not an existential.
2008-11-12 08:48 mdmkolbe         Lemmih: () has one object in it's type.  void has no objects in it's type.  I should probably do "data Void -- no constructors" and use "Ptr Void" isntead of "Ptr ()"
2008-11-12 08:48 mm_freak         Lemmih: but it wouldn't be wrong, if

2008-11-12 08:49 mdmkolbe         dolio: ah, yes.  I think it is really "data Foo = forall a. Foo (Ptr a)" but the same problem remains: the result isn't a Ptr anymore
2008-11-12 08:49 Lemmih           mdmkolbe: That will also work.
2008-11-12 08:49 dolio            Man, Agda takes an absurd amount of memory.
2008-11-12 08:49 mm_freak         mofmog: yes, () is a value of type ()

2008-11-12 08:50 mm_freak         it's called the 'unit type' for some reason
2008-11-12 08:50 mdmkolbe         mofmog: () is called the "unit type" because it has exactly one value in it (just like the binary type has two values in it)
2008-11-12 08:50 mm_freak         lilac: how that?
2008-11-12 08:51 Twey             /join 
2008-11-12 08:51 lilac            mm_freak: in the sense that 'error "hello"' != 'error "world"'
2008-11-12 08:51 mdmkolbe         (well binary or boolean more commonly)
2008-11-12 08:51 mm_freak         lilac: computationally they are equivalent in that the function does not return a result
2008-11-12 08:52 lilac            mm_freak: if we had a full semantics for haskell they'd be different, due to 'catch'-type stuff
2008-11-12 08:52 lilac            but i do take your point
2008-11-12 08:52 mm_freak         the result of the function is bottom, no matter how the bottom is 'reached'…  the value 'bottom' is always the same
2008-11-12 08:53 mdmkolbe         lilac: in semantics actually 'undefined' is observationally equivalent to 'undefined' so there is only one bottom in semantics (I'm excluding hooks haskell mihgt have in "error")
2008-11-12 08:53 mofmog           There is only nothing and error, and when meditated upon, the error is nothing- thus there is nothing.
2008-11-12 08:54 mm_freak         mdmkolbe: back to your problem, you're not looking for existential types, but for quantification…  this is something you'd use in type signatures
2008-11-12 08:54 mdmkolbe         /action gives mofmog a Zen cookie
2008-11-12 08:54 lilac            mdmkolbe: you assume that all bottom values are 'undefined' in the semantics, but they can't be in any semantics which includes IO

2008-11-12 09:09 lilac            as i understand it, the monad laws are generally interpreted to make no guarantees about behaviour in presence of bottoms
2008-11-12 09:10 lilac            so the only guarantees about the computation actually being done have to come from the monad itself
2008-11-12 09:10 hackage          Uploaded to hackage: haskell-src-exts 0.3.10
2008-11-12 09:10 mdmkolbe         ok, yeah.  WriterT w Unit a = () so we are ok, but I don't think you could write a UnitT
2008-11-12 09:10 Twey             /quit Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)
2008-11-12 09:11 lilac            what's the problem with UnitT?
2008-11-12 09:11 mm_freak         you could, but it wouldn't be much different from Unit
2008-11-12 09:11 mm_freak         lift _ = ()
2008-11-12 09:11 lilac            type UnitT m a = ()
2008-11-12 09:11 ddarius          lilac: One can choose differing notions of "=" for doing the monad laws, but there is nothing about bottom that makes the monad laws meaningless.
2008-11-12 09:11 mofmog           /part #haskell 
2008-11-12 09:11 dolio            Scratch that, Const a isn't a monad.
2008-11-12 09:11 BONUS            UnitT has just one more phantom type
2008-11-12 09:11 dolio            Just an applicative.
2008-11-12 09:12 ddarius          lilac: The natural choice for "=" is observational equality in which case the monad laws need to hold even with bottom.
2008-11-12 09:12 mdmkolbe         lilac: wouldn't the natural UnitT m = m ()?
2008-11-12 09:12 lilac            ddarius: sure, but as far as i remember, many common monads aren't, if you consider = to count for bottoms too
2008-11-12 09:12 dolio            It's only a monad when all elements are equal to the unit of the monoid (which is () and anything isomorphic to it).
2008-11-12 09:12 mdmkolbe         lilac: but then UnitT (Writer w) a = ((), w) which is obviously wrong (you shouldn't be able to get the w out), thus the obvious UnitT is wrong
2008-11-12 09:13 BONUS            hmm dunno
2008-11-12 09:14 BONUS            UnitT Maybe a ---> Just () or Nothing
2008-11-12 09:14 BONUS            looks ok and i think the laws would hold, although someone would have to check
2008-11-12 09:15 mdmkolbe         BONUS: that would be very bad.  because how would you evaluate "return 1 >>= \x -> if x == 1 then return 2 else Nothing"

2008-11-12 09:18 mm_freak         i can picture Just undefined and Nothing on separate 'leaves' of the order 'tree', just above undefined, right?
2008-11-12 09:18 ddarius          mdmkolbe: The latter is the "sensible" definition.
2008-11-12 09:18 dolio            return = undefined doesn't work.
2008-11-12 09:18 dolio            Becuase m >>= return = undefined, then.
2008-11-12 09:18 lilac            how about: data BottomMonad a; instance Monad BottomMonad where;
2008-11-12 09:18 geezusfreeek     here we go: (>>=) = _|_; return = _|_
2008-11-12 09:19 ddarius          mm_freak: Nothing is a leaf, Just undefined would be a node, but yes, they are on different branches from undefined.
2008-11-12 09:19 BONUS            hmmm interesting indeed
2008-11-12 09:19 dolio            Presumably.
2008-11-12 09:19 mdmkolbe         ddarius: aren't there some kind of transformer laws that would prevent such a cop out?
2008-11-12 09:19 mm_freak         ddarius: that's what i meant
2008-11-12 09:19 lilac            dolio: m >>= return = undefined, but what values can m take?
2008-11-12 09:20 dolio            Are we discussing BottomMonad now, or UnitT, still?
2008-11-12 09:20 lilac            BottomMonad right now
2008-11-12 09:20 ddarius          mdmkolbe: There are laws for transformers, but I don't believe they disallow that.
2008-11-12 09:20 dolio            (>>=) = return = undefined is fine for BottomMonad, but not for UnitT.

2008-11-12 09:25 mdmkolbe         Saizan: ##workingset would be a good place to ask

2008-11-12 09:27 mdmkolbe         lilac: it looks like it b/c all objects would be the same. namely, UnitT (return ())
2008-11-12 09:27 mdmkolbe         (at least as far as the monad laws go, I'm not sure about the transformer laws)

2008-11-12 09:36 dolio            Yeah. So you have to ensure that 'return a >>= f' the same thing as 'f a' without using f, which can only work in general if there is only one value of type UnitT m a.
2008-11-12 09:36 mm_freak         bbs: yes, but your base case was wrong anyway =)
2008-11-12 09:37 bbs              yep

2008-11-12 09:37 FunctorSalad_    UnitT? =)
2008-11-12 09:38 dolio            Although that's probably still kind of a problem, strictly speaking.
2008-11-12 09:39 mm_freak         (i find it amazing how haskell has an gigantic theoretic background)
2008-11-12 09:39 dolio            Since if you do '_ >>= _ = ()' then 'return 5 >>= const undefined = () /= undefined'.
2008-11-12 09:39 dolio            And even 'm >>= f = m `seq` f `seq` ()' doesn't help.
2008-11-12 09:40 dolio            But that's a problem with Unit, too.

2008-11-12 09:53 Twey             Oh wait
2008-11-12 09:53 Twey             No, not quite
2008-11-12 09:53 Twey             Heh
2008-11-12 09:53 Twey             Why do both Array and IArray exist?
2008-11-12 09:53 mdmkolbe         that looks like what the compile shouts if you doo that: aiiiiiieeeeee  --> 'm bye
2008-11-12 09:53 mm_freak         IArray is a class
2008-11-12 09:54 Twey             Isn't IArray's functionality a superset of Array's?
2008-11-12 09:54 Twey             Haha, mdmkolbe
2008-11-12 09:54 Twey             It says: « Note: The Data.Array.IArray module provides a more general interface to immutable arrays: it defines operations with the same names as those defined below, but with more general types, and also defines Array instances of the relevant classes. To use that more general interface, import Data.Array.IArray but not Data.Array. »
2008-11-12 09:55 Twey             It seems kind of like a splitAt/generalSplitAt situation
2008-11-12 09:55 ddarius          Twey: Data.Array is where H98 Array moved.
2008-11-12 09:55 Twey             @hoogle a -> [b] -> ([b], [b])

2008-11-12 09:55 lambdabot        Data.List splitAt :: Int -> [a] -> ([a], [a])
2008-11-12 09:55 Twey             genericSplitAt, even.
2008-11-12 09:55 Twey             ddarius: So it's just for compatibility?
2008-11-12 09:55 ddarius          I imagine.
2008-11-12 09:55 christos_        Is it possible to type in GHCi non-latin characters?

2008-11-12 10:01 dolio            Yeah, 6.8 was still readline.

2008-11-12 10:02 mdmkolbe         Twey: readline is GPL, editline is BSD(?)
2008-11-12 10:02 Twey             I guess so.

2008-11-12 10:02 Twey             editline seems quite inferior, though.
2008-11-12 10:02 Twey             I'm surprised they didn't make their own implementation.

2008-11-12 10:05 Twey             Is there a fork of GHC 6.10 with a readline GHCi?
2008-11-12 10:05 mofmog           dont they all have readline
2008-11-12 10:05 dolio            Someone said they compiled it by hand, and it pulled in readline since they didn't have editline.
2008-11-12 10:05 Twey             Lack of Unicode is pretty severe for me, although I guess I can just mess about with ghc proper.
2008-11-12 10:06 dolio            So it may be just the officially distributed builds that prefer editline.
2008-11-12 10:06 Twey             Mm.

2008-11-17 10:21 Adamant          like 30's

Usually by that point you're ahead of schedule and you can use the extra time to figure out how to improve your algorithms and often the low level details of optimization just don't matter.

2008-11-17 10:49 schoenfinkel     This attack on the teahers seems wrong, doesn't it?  why shouldn't they use haskell as the underlying language for exhibiting lots of distinctions, people write Haskell interpreters in Haskell, for example, why not ML too, and so forth?
2008-11-17 10:49 ivanm            sclv: unfortunately, most keyboards (and AFAIK, most encodings) fail to differentiate between the subtraction and negation characters
2008-11-17 10:49 SamB             schoenfinkel: uh, what?
2008-11-17 10:49 ivanm            schoenfinkel: AFAICT, the attack was on the teacher forcing them to implement laziness in a lazy language
2008-11-17 10:49 schoenfinkel     I couldn't follow the problem he was supposed to sove
2008-11-17 10:49 schoenfinkel     quite
2008-11-17 10:49 SamB             if they are actually teaching Haskell, they probably ought to have learned it first
2008-11-17 10:50 DustyDingo       ok, strange question
2008-11-17 10:50 SamB             if they aren't, they should have told their students that
2008-11-17 10:50 lispy            DustyDingo: strange answer
2008-11-17 10:50 schoenfinkel     Suppose Haskell was the only programming language there had ever been

2008-11-17 10:50 DustyDingo       i have a batch file for hugs, where i want to print the command i enter
2008-11-17 10:50 schoenfinkel     I might want to give people the idea of strict evaluation
2008-11-17 10:50 DustyDingo       and then execute it

2008-11-17 10:50 DustyDingo       so i tried for e.g.: putStrLn " isPic (bpic 1) "  >>  isPic (bpic 1)
2008-11-17 10:50 schoenfinkel     So I do something complicated that shows strict v. lazy
2008-11-17 10:50 Spark            the students should be smart enough to do a stupid coursework
2008-11-17 10:50 ivanm            but you don't re-write strict eval in a strict language
2008-11-17 10:51 ivanm            it just does it
2008-11-17 10:51 schoenfinkel     that's the problem he was put
2008-11-17 10:51 substack         you could use perl6 ;)
2008-11-17 10:51 DustyDingo       but the problem is, that doesn't work for all functions
2008-11-17 10:51 schoenfinkel     Yeah, but they're learning everything in Haskell

2008-11-17 10:51 ivanm            schoenfinkel: when you learnt C/Java/whatever, did you learn strict evaluation by defining strict evaluation in that language?
2008-11-17 10:52 ivanm            DustyDingo: because that's all it works for ;-)
2008-11-17 10:52 Saizan_          DustyDingo: for pure ones you want to wrap them in something like "print"
2008-11-17 10:52 schoenfinkel     No you could only learn it
2008-11-17 10:52 schoenfinkel     by learning strict v. lazy
2008-11-17 10:52 schoenfinkel     that is, by developing the opposition, neither would be in the form given by the language
2008-11-17 10:52 ivanm            schoenfinkel: so why should you learn lazy evaluation by defining lazy evaluation in a lazy language?
2008-11-17 10:52 arw              almost. there are cases, where java and c are lazy.
2008-11-17 10:53 SamB             schoenfinkel: I don't understand you ...
2008-11-17 10:53 arw              like foo() || bar()
2008-11-17 10:53 te               /join 
2008-11-17 10:53 schoenfinkel     No, he's learning it by learning strict versus lazy; and by developing the two different things in one language
2008-11-17 10:53 schoenfinkel     It happens that it is lazy
2008-11-17 10:53 ivanm            arw: and there are cases where haskell is strict (though you usually have to be explicit about it)
2008-11-17 10:53 DustyDingo       Saizan_: ahm that could work
2008-11-17 10:53 substack         is short circuiting even in the c standard?

2008-11-17 10:53 lispy            substack: of course

2008-11-17 10:57 lispy            ivanm: stupid in which ways?
2008-11-17 10:57 ivanm            lispy: the whole appending "-dev" to packages
2008-11-17 10:58 SamB             ivan: what makes that stupid ?
2008-11-17 10:58 ivanm            and calling it libghc6-stm rather than stm (or haskell-stm)
2008-11-17 10:58 SamB             ivanm: it only works for GHC though
2008-11-17 10:58 te               ivanm: okay i grabbed it off hackage
2008-11-17 10:58 ivanm            SamB: because that's not the actual name of that library?
2008-11-17 10:58 te               im in the dir, what should i run?
2008-11-17 10:58 te               to install this lib
2008-11-17 10:58 ivan             ivanm: sorry to ruin your tab completion stuff
2008-11-17 10:58 ivanm            ivan: so you should be!
2008-11-17 10:58 ivanm            not to mention stealing the nick I wanted! ;-)
2008-11-17 10:59 ivan             i've stolen this one back at least 3 times

2008-11-17 10:59 lispy            ivanm: I do agree that the way debian packages GHC is suboptimal. But, I'm told they have good reason for splicing it up into bits.
2008-11-17 10:59 ivanm            well, it was taken when I started using IRC a few years ago, so I appended the initial of my surname
2008-11-17 10:59 SamB             ivanm: the package doesn't contain the Haskell package in an abstract sense

2008-11-17 11:00 ivanm            lispy: I might be biased, but I prefer USE flags to "let's rebuild it numerous multiple times with different compile options and give each build a different but similar package name" :s
2008-11-17 11:00 Saizan_          te: runghc Setup configure; runghc Setup build; sudo runghc Setup install
2008-11-17 11:00 ivanm            SamB: in what way?
2008-11-17 11:00 lispy            I stopped using the debian packaged GHC and a lot of my grievances went away.  Imagine that.
2008-11-17 11:00 SamB             it contains the highly-GHC-version-specific .o and .hi files
2008-11-17 11:00 ivanm            lispy: lol
2008-11-17 11:00 ivanm            SamB: ahhhhh
2008-11-17 11:00 ivanm            source-based package management ftw! ;-)
2008-11-17 11:01 lispy            source-based package management for the oh wait...just a second, it's going to take another hour to build this...

2008-11-17 11:02 SamB             if any
2008-11-17 11:02 DustyDingo       but is there a show, which would also work for IO()?

2008-11-17 11:03 Twey             DustyDingo: show does work for IO ()
2008-11-17 11:03 ivanm            takes about 30 minutes here though
2008-11-17 11:03 mm_freak_        DustyDingo: then no…  and IO actions can't be printed
2008-11-17 11:03 ivanm            \o/
2008-11-17 11:03 Plouj            that's so convoluted...
2008-11-17 11:04 Plouj            what I learned today is that I don't point-free functions
2008-11-17 11:04 ivanm            Plouj: generally, you don't _entirely_ point-free your functions
2008-11-17 11:04 Saizan_          ?type \f g -> filter f . map g
2008-11-17 11:04 lambdabot        forall a b. (b -> Bool) -> (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

2008-11-17 11:05 DustyDingo       any good idea, how to do that?
2008-11-17 11:05 Twey             What you *should* have learnt today is that you should only point-free your functions if they look nicer point-free. :)
2008-11-17 11:05 ivanm            @pl \g l -> filter f (map g l)
2008-11-17 11:05 lambdabot        (filter f .) . map

2008-11-17 11:05 lambdabot        filter f . map g
2008-11-17 11:05 Twey             DustyDingo: What do you actually want to do?
2008-11-17 11:05 ivanm            Plouj: ^^ pick the variant that suits you best
2008-11-17 11:05 DustyDingo       for e.g. can i write a generic function, which can tes the type?
2008-11-17 11:05 DustyDingo       like, for IO() do this for any other do that
2008-11-17 11:05 ivanm            DustyDingo: not really....
2008-11-17 11:05 ivanm            there is typable stuff, but it's not that easy to use
2008-11-17 11:05 Twey             What type would that have?
2008-11-17 11:05 Saizan_          DustyDingo: you can make an instance of Show for IO
2008-11-17 11:06 ivanm            and you then lose one of the main benefits of Haskell: static typing picking up compile-time errors
2008-11-17 11:06 DustyDingo       Saizan_: that gets overloaded if defined in the same module?
2008-11-17 11:06 ivanm            /action still remembers spending ages trying to track down a bug that resulted from the wrong % item in a printf string :s
2008-11-17 11:06 Saizan_          DustyDingo: it will look like instance Show (IO ()) where show _ = "IO ()"
2008-11-17 11:06 Saizan_          DustyDingo: typeclasses is how haskell does overloading

Topological spaces, connectedness, compactness, continuous mappings and homeomorphisms. Prereq
2008-11-17 11:07 DustyDingo       Saizan_: ok
2008-11-17 11:07 ivanm            schoenfinkel: any particular reason for the subject selection spam? ;-)
2008-11-17 11:07 heatsink         Speaking of which, I learned recently that Concepts are how C++ does typeclasses.
2008-11-17 11:07 Saizan_          ..except Show (IO ()) is not h98, but Show (IO a) is

2008-11-17 11:07 schoenfinkel     this is the course, Im trying to figure out if they could be as stupid as you guys were making out
2008-11-17 11:07 cads             schoenfinkel, sounds like a fun little introductory course
2008-11-17 11:07 schoenfinkel     yeah
2008-11-17 11:08 ivanm            schoenfinkel: they're making bbs implement laziness in a lazy language
2008-11-17 11:08 schoenfinkel     my point above wasnt too clear.  Surely the following problem make sense... it wasnt the one put to them ....
2008-11-17 11:08 ivanm            I still call that crazy
2008-11-17 11:08 Twey             schoenfinkel: Never underestimate potential stupidity of people.
2008-11-17 11:08 ivanm            @remember Twey Never underestimate potential stupidity of people.
2008-11-17 11:08 lambdabot        I will remember.
2008-11-17 11:08 schoenfinkel     here is a specification of a miniature lazy language..... write an interpreter
2008-11-17 11:09 schoenfinkel     here is a spec of a miniature strict one, write an interpreter
2008-11-17 11:09 ivanm            schoenfinkel: but from what bbs was saying, that wasn't it at all
2008-11-17 11:09 schoenfinkel     does that make sense
2008-11-17 11:09 ivanm            he had to implement laziness in Haskell
2008-11-17 11:09 schoenfinkel     no that wasnt it, as i said
2008-11-17 11:09 Plouj            well, the general problem is that I don't get how to remove "points" from functions and what points are
2008-11-17 11:09 Plouj            anyone have a good link to a tutorial that can help me?
2008-11-17 11:09 schoenfinkel     thats true, but I think he just wasn't communicating what the problem was
2008-11-17 11:09 Twey             Well, no, it's not just 'implementing laziness in Haskell'
2008-11-17 11:09 ivanm            Plouj: points == input parameters (roughly)
2008-11-17 11:09 ivanm            Twey: it wasn't?
2008-11-17 11:09 Twey             It's more a case of 'trying to force Haskell to be lazy'
2008-11-17 11:09 ivanm            /action must have missed that bit
2008-11-17 11:09 Saizan_          Plouj: the points are the formal parameters
2008-11-17 11:09 ivanm            Plouj: the pointfree wiki page
2008-11-17 11:10 Philonous_       Plouj: Think math there. "The function f at point x is ...".
2008-11-17 11:10 mm_freak_        Plouj: if you have a function "subtractOne" and "square", then you can write the function "f x = (x-1)^2" as "f = square . subtractOne"
2008-11-17 11:11 mm_freak_        haskell allows you to write "square" as "(^2)" and "subtractOne" as "subtact 1":  f = (^2) . subtract 1

2008-11-17 11:11 Philonous_       Poinless style is just like unix pipes reversed. You feed the output of one function into the input of the next function

2008-11-17 11:12 Twey             When is it negate, and when is it subtract?
2008-11-17 11:12 mm_freak_        Plouj: that's the first step in describing things in terms of what they are, instead of what they do to their input =)

2008-11-17 11:13 twb              Lately I've been having problems with GHC 6.8 segfaulting when compiling Darcs' HashedIO.hs.  Could the "segfault" actually be the kernel OOM-killing the process, or out of space on /tmp (which is a ramdisk)?
2008-11-17 11:13 arw              Plouj: "pointed": f x = sin x, point-free: f = sin. the first tells you what f does to x. the latter tells you what transformation f is.
2008-11-17 11:13 cads             hey, you guys know of a semantic network type database that'd let you define functions like 'is a name of an animal', which would be able to sort natural strings according to their linguistic content?
2008-11-17 11:13 Plouj            ok, cool
2008-11-17 11:13 mm_freak_        in fact there is even a 'pure' approach to this, which is called 'function-level programming'
2008-11-17 11:14 Twey             cads: That's one of the goals of the Semantic Web, I believe
2008-11-17 11:14 mm_freak_        'pure' in that it doesn't even know about points

2008-11-17 11:16 cads             Twey, can that be used in fun little projects? I want to use it to separate pictures called "cute kitten" and "herd of zebras" from the rest of the pictures in my pictures folder :D
2008-11-17 11:16 Philonous_       Right. I actually meant functional composition. Never mind.
2008-11-17 11:16 Twey             It's a little bigger than that :-P
2008-11-17 11:16 Twey             You could maybe try LogicT or, hey, Prolog or Curry
2008-11-17 11:17 arw              unix pipes compare to function composition. like print . head . sort compares to sort | head -n 1 | cat
2008-11-17 11:18 Twey             Arrows are more direct, because the order is the same :)

2008-11-17 11:21 arw              on intel segv is also the signal you get for an alignment error (which can occur only in sse and mmx instructions). does ghc use those instruction sets?
2008-11-17 11:21 cads             Twey, I think my AI book uses logic programming for natural language processing. I'll see what it says. And wow, the semantic web actually sounds a little scary

2008-11-17 11:32 topo             is haskell a new version of lisp?
2008-11-17 11:32 SethTisue        YES
2008-11-17 11:32 Saizan_          more like a new version of ML
2008-11-17 11:33 ivanm            Saizan_: is it?
2008-11-17 11:33 heatsink         yup
2008-11-17 11:33 heatsink         it's in the family of languages derived from ML, which was originally written for writing strategies for theorem provers.
2008-11-17 11:33 topo             what ML?>
2008-11-17 11:33 twb              heatsink: I thought ML was written to write compilers
2008-11-17 11:34 topo             but is there any relation between haskell and lisp
2008-11-17 11:34 Saizan_          topo: haskell is quite different from LISP since it's purely functional and typed
2008-11-17 11:34 twb              Well, ISTR early ML implementations were written in Lisp.
2008-11-17 11:34 topo             ummmh
2008-11-17 11:34 Saizan_          topo: LISP is also seen as a functional language
2008-11-17 11:34 twb              Saizan_: Lisp supports FP and strict, static typing.
2008-11-17 11:35 twb              They are just "opt in"
2008-11-17 11:35 Saizan_          yeah

2008-11-17 11:45 SethTisue        by "evolve" in Lisp, i assume you mean "you can change something in the code and it will still compile, but not work"
2008-11-17 11:46 topo             in common lisp programs are trees and you have access to those trees so its very good for recombining programs, selection, crossover and mutation of programms
2008-11-17 11:46 lispy            topo: also, I find that ghci encourages the healthy habbit of flushing all the old definitions from memory when you reload...this has saved me considerable time
2008-11-17 11:46 topo             very easy to evolve programs

2008-11-17 12:00 lispy            I recommend not using 'type' though.  It tends to obfuscate things more than it tends to help
2008-11-17 12:00 necroforest      If you want to use a type class like Eq would the syntax be 'type (Eq a) = (a, Int)'
2008-11-17 12:00 necroforest      ah, well I'm writing vector functions... so i was going to have type Vector t = (t, t)
2008-11-17 12:01 necroforest      would 'data Vector t = Vector (t, t)' be better?

2008-11-17 12:02 ivanm            however, you're usually better off having the Eq requirement when you actually use the data structure

2008-11-17 12:27 thoughtpolice    mmorrow: one of the things I was thinking of recently was what if you had a haskell compiler that used harpy to execute the haskell code its given, and in the code generate calls back into haskell functions in the compiler, effectively writing your RTS for the compiler in haskell?
2008-11-17 12:28 necroforest      GHC says that (+) is "ambiguous".. but shouldn't it be valid since i'm defining it on different datatypes than in Prelude?

2008-11-17 14:39 Bitrot           Can anyone help me with a simple type theory question?
2008-11-17 14:40 arw              perhaps, perhaps not.

2008-11-17 14:40 Bitrot           Well, let's give it  shot: Why aren't type variables considered a "top type"?
2008-11-17 14:40 arw              we can answer that question only if you first ask the other question.

2008-11-17 14:42 Bitrot           In case anyone else is around....if I have a function \x.x, any value is a valid argument. So, to me, the type of x seems to fulfill the requirement of Top (ie, any value can inhabit the type). I can't find anything online where type variables are used in this way so I'm wondering what I'm missing.
2008-11-17 14:44 Axman6           bleh, i wish more docs about ideas in haskell talked more about the uses and how to use things, than the theory behind them, leaving you with knowledge without knowing how to use it
2008-11-17 14:45 dolio            Top, in a type system that allowed it, would be something like (exists a. a).

2008-11-17 14:47 Bitrot           Dolio 1) I don't really get how existential types work (sorry) and 2) How does a function type capture all possible values? I don't see how something like "3" fits in there.

2008-11-17 14:51 dolio            Bitrot: The main idea is that you can encode data as the eliminator for that data, and the eliminator for an existential is a universal.
2008-11-17 14:52 Bitrot           Hmmm...if I had  a function f :: exists a. a -> a, how does that differ from the identity function (id :: forall a. a -> a)?
2008-11-17 14:52 ski_             Bitrot : a problem with interpreting type variables as a `Top' type is that if you e.g. pass a value of type `Int' to `\x. x', then using `Int' for the `Top' argument type here wouldn't be *independent* on how to interpret the result type

2008-11-17 14:56 mmorrow          forall and exists are duals just like products and sums are duals just like object oriented and functional are duals just like ...
2008-11-17 14:56 dolio            Because (exists x. x) has some particular unknown type, so to eliminate it, you need a function that accepts all types.
2008-11-17 14:57 ski_             Bitrot : a distinguishing thing between type variables in general, and `Top' (or `Bot', ..) is that each occurance of the same type variable must stand for the same type, whenever we actually replace the type variable with a type (in the case of `forall' .. for `exists' we'd replace the type with a type variable)
2008-11-17 14:57 Bitrot           OK, I sort of get it. (except for that last bit by morrow). However, could you have a function (exists a. a->a) by itself (without some hidden type you're unaware of)?

2008-11-17 15:01 dolio            With GHC you can make a type 'data EFun = forall x. EF (x -> x)' and do 'foo :: EFun ; foo = EF ((\x -> x + 1) :: Int -> Int)'

2008-11-17 16:21 vincenz          ski_: well I don't see why the CPs of a pair is a pair, since nwo you have two places to pass a continuation, and I don't quite get the second one, or what the Z stands for

2008-11-17 16:21 vincenz          shouldn't the CPS transfo encode L-to-R ?
2008-11-17 16:21 ski_             we define a translation from a language with functions and pairs, which maps expressions into expressions where every application is in tail-position
2008-11-17 16:22 ski_             there are several variants of CPS .. the call-by-value variant would typically encode L-to-R (or R-to-L) of applications
2008-11-17 16:22 vincenz          How come the CPS of a function results in a pair?
2008-11-17 16:23 ski_             no
2008-11-17 16:23 vincenz          Or rather, a function taking a pair to some arbitrary Z
2008-11-17 16:23 ski_             it results in a function from a pair type to the answer type
2008-11-17 16:23 ski_             the pair is the pair of the input argument to the function, and the output continuation to continue with

2008-11-17 16:24 ski_             you may think of the continuation as a "return address" if you wish
2008-11-17 16:24 vincenz          Right
2008-11-17 16:24 vincenz          I know what continuations are, just this formulation is rather novel to me.
2008-11-17 16:24 vincenz          But thanks :)
2008-11-17 16:24 ski_             this is encoding continuations as functions to an answer type
2008-11-17 16:25 ski_             one could just as well have used `Cont' instead of `(-> Z)'
2008-11-17 16:25 vincenz          What is the CPS of a plain type?
2008-11-17 16:25 vincenz          Cps (int -> int) === (int, int -> Z) -> Z ?

2008-11-17 17:49 SubStack         I usually rewrite them when they start wrapping to the next line
2008-11-17 17:49 BeelsebobWork    so you need to convert your Int to a RealFrac a => a

2008-11-17 17:51 BeelsebobWork    sjanssen: yeh -- but it doesn't matter in something that is really a list comprehension
2008-11-17 17:51 BeelsebobWork    i.e. if it's a list comprehension, it can be thought of non-sequentially, and there's no reason to sequentialise it with do
2008-11-17 17:51 sjanssen         BeelsebobWork: a list comprehension is also sequential
2008-11-17 17:51 grom358          so how do I round down the result from sqrt to Int?
2008-11-17 17:51 BeelsebobWork    sjanssen: yes -- but it doesn't expose the sequentiality to the outside world

2008-11-17 17:53 SubStack         and then fromIntegral on that

2008-11-17 17:54 sjanssen         BeelsebobWork: you also need to consider cases where a prior list is infinitely long
2008-11-17 17:54 BeelsebobWork    surprise surprise, that produces different results
2008-11-17 17:54 ski_             the sequentiality of the list monad translates into different nesting levels of the "loops"
2008-11-17 17:54 BeelsebobWork    it's not explicitly writing a sequential program though
2008-11-17 17:54 ski_             it is
2008-11-17 17:54 sjanssen         how is it any different?
2008-11-17 17:54 BeelsebobWork    it's different in terms of program style only
2008-11-17 17:54 BeelsebobWork    one program is sequential

2008-11-17 18:00 BeelsebobWork    when in fact, that stepping behavior *isn't* there
2008-11-17 18:01 BeelsebobWork    because lazy evaluation can do it any way it likes

2008-11-17 18:03 BeelsebobWork    quicksilver: the letter "f" has no connotations (except perhaps to mathematitions), the word "do" implies sequentiality

2008-11-17 18:09 SubStack         wow, I think pointless haskell has helped me avoid using odd-sounding pronouns like "one"
2008-11-17 18:09 sjanssen         I can't think of many monads where sequence doesn't matter.  Reader is the only one that comes to mind immediately
2008-11-17 18:09 SubStack         that always bugs me when people overuse that, sounds like the queen talking
2008-11-17 18:10 BeelsebobWork    sjanssen: I can't say I can think of more off the top of my head -- but it's certainly possible to write them
2008-11-17 18:10 quicksilver      BeelsebobWork: all I'm saying is wasting time worry about those implications is just that, wasting time.
2008-11-17 18:10 ski_             BeelsebobWork : no, it *is* there .. the sequentiality i mean is that in `do x <- a; y <- f x; ...' the `y' *depends* on `x' and therefore on performing the effects in `a' needed to produce `x'
2008-11-17 18:10 quicksilver      because those implications aren't really there.
2008-11-17 18:10 BeelsebobWork    quicksilver: in my mind, it certainly isn't wasting time
2008-11-17 18:10 C-Keen           hm if I want to round a value to an Int, can't I use floor ?
2008-11-17 18:10 BeelsebobWork    because the implications *are* there in anyone but the most expert haskell users
2008-11-17 18:10 quicksilver      ski_: that's true but that kind of data demand dependency exists in all styles of code
2008-11-17 18:11 BeelsebobWork    and there are perfectly good other ways of writing the code

2008-11-17 18:15 ski_             (BeelsebobWork : also, different POVs are useful for different things)
2008-11-17 18:15 BeelsebobWork    I want it less obvious, because it's not part of the behavior of my program that I care about
2008-11-17 18:15 BeelsebobWork    and nor should anyone reading it care about it
2008-11-17 18:15 BeelsebobWork    ski_: sure -- and there *are* uses for do where I *want* the reader to see the sequentiality
2008-11-17 18:16 BeelsebobWork    I don't tend to use them often
2008-11-17 18:16 BeelsebobWork    but they exist
2008-11-17 18:18 kisu__           /quit Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)
2008-11-17 18:18 ski_             in the `Applicative' case above, i'd say that there's no inherent sequencing in the sense of sequencing in `do' .. since later actions cannot depend on results of previous actions .. so, i suppose you could call that a "more pure" formulation, if you like
2008-11-17 18:18 ski_             (i think conal would agree with that)
2008-11-17 18:18 BeelsebobWork    I'd agree with that too
2008-11-17 18:20 askentasken      points-free has points, why?
2008-11-17 18:20 ski_             not using `(>>=)' (or `join'), (or not over-sequentializing things with arrows) implementations have more room to perform computations in whatever low operational order fits better, so there is a possible efficiency-gain, too
2008-11-17 18:20 Taejo            askentasken: "points" refers to the "points" (values) in the "space" of values
2008-11-17 18:21 Taejo            it's from topology
2008-11-17 18:21 grom358          okay.. I got head . filter (> 5) $ map (length . factors . triangleNum) [1..] . But I want to find out the result of triangleNum when the length of the factors is > 5
2008-11-17 18:21 ski_             askentasken : "." is not a point, it is the composition operator .. the points are the values of the datatypes being transformed
2008-11-17 18:21 askentasken      does Gdels imcompleteness theorem mean all mathematics would always have to be based on something that cant be proved or that was the case anyway? ie is the search for foundational math an oxymoron?
2008-11-17 18:21 askentasken      ski_ aha!
2008-11-17 18:21 sjanssen         ski_: results can depend on the implicit results hidden in the applicative functor, however
2008-11-17 18:22 Taejo            askentasken: that is the case in any logic
2008-11-17 18:22 grom358          ah.. nvm I think I know
2008-11-17 18:22 ski_             (of course, in `Applicative' there can still be a sequencing in the sense of some things occuring "to the left" of other things .. and also there's of course the usual dataflow dependencies of the values computed by the actions)
2008-11-17 18:22 Taejo            what the incompleteness theorem says is that *no* set of axioms can prove all of arithmetic
2008-11-17 18:23 ski_             sjanssen : if you use effectful operations, yea

2008-11-17 22:47 EmielRegis       ah ye
2008-11-17 22:47 EmielRegis       but im getting error on mv1 init
2008-11-17 22:47 BeelsebobWork    also, add two spaces on the first line so that things line up and you can see that more obviously
2008-11-17 22:47 EmielRegis       couldnt match expected type [t] against inferred type IO MVar a

2008-11-17 22:48 ToRA|MSR         i assume it's IO (MVar a)
2008-11-17 22:48 BeelsebobWork    also, do res <- (renderY 0   299 renderBoundY origin); putMVare mv1 res) is nicer as renderY 0   299 renderBoundY origin >>= putMVar mv1
2008-11-17 22:48 ToRA|MSR         and your function has type [[ColourT]]
2008-11-17 22:48 ToRA|MSR         [[ColourT]] != IO
2008-11-17 22:49 EmielRegis       but it should return (r1++r2), which should be colours

2008-11-17 22:50 BeelsebobWork    some code clean up... http://hpaste.org/12131#a1
2008-11-17 22:50 quicksilver      it may "return" (r1++r2)

2008-11-17 22:53 BeelsebobWork    that should do it then... http://hpaste.org/12131#a2
2008-11-17 22:54 BeelsebobWork    but... why are you using forkIO if this is a pure computation?
2008-11-17 22:54 EmielRegis       uhm, what else should I use?
2008-11-17 22:54 geezusfreeek     EmielRegis, another thing you should be aware of: forking those threads won't actually speed anything up. they will just point the references to thunks
2008-11-17 22:54 luite            /join 
2008-11-17 22:54 geezusfreeek     EmielRegis, you should look at the `par` function, perhaps
2008-11-17 22:55 EmielRegis       i wanted the raytraces to run in parallel...
2008-11-17 22:55 BeelsebobWork    EmielRegis: http://hpaste.org/12131#a3
2008-11-17 22:55 BeelsebobWork    no IO
2008-11-17 22:55 quicksilver      geezusfreeek: well his render functions are apparently in IO
2008-11-17 22:55 BeelsebobWork    no forkIO
2008-11-17 22:55 geezusfreeek     quicksilver, oh!
2008-11-17 22:56 quicksilver      well maybe they're not ;)
2008-11-17 22:56 quicksilver      I thought they were.
2008-11-17 22:56 BeelsebobWork    quicksilver: he said their type was [[ColourT]]
2008-11-17 22:56 EmielRegis       my render function doesnt return IO... it only writes the resulting pixles into ppm, but thats once calculations are done
2008-11-17 22:56 quicksilver      geezusfreeek: `par` has no magic benefit over forkIO anyhow.
2008-11-17 22:56 Hong_MinHee      /quit 
2008-11-17 22:56 BeelsebobWork    quicksilver: other than it doesn't force you into the IO monad
2008-11-17 22:56 geezusfreeek     quicksilver, it's pure
2008-11-17 22:56 geezusfreeek     right
2008-11-17 22:56 quicksilver      geezusfreeek: `par` on two list thunks will only check they're both non-empty
2008-11-17 22:56 quicksilver      geezusfreeek: it won't solve the problem you correctly pointed out
2008-11-17 22:56 BeelsebobWork    EmielRegis: if renderY happens to be an application of map, then just change map to parMap rnf
2008-11-17 22:57 geezusfreeek     quicksilver, yes, i you are right. that was an oops on my part

2008-11-17 22:57 BeelsebobWork    EmielRegis: not map renderRow [top..bottom]?
2008-11-17 22:57 EmielRegis       no
2008-11-17 22:57 EmielRegis       it runs a recursive function that renders all X
2008-11-17 22:57 EmielRegis       then goes to next row
2008-11-17 22:57 EmielRegis       and does same
2008-11-17 22:58 geezusfreeek     strategies or dph would be the way to go i guess
2008-11-17 22:58 EmielRegis       and what is rnf?
2008-11-17 22:58 BeelsebobWork    EmielRegis: I'd expect this to work... http://hpaste.org/12131#a4
2008-11-17 22:58 BeelsebobWork    where renderRow is a function that renders a single row
2008-11-17 22:58 EmielRegis       ah
2008-11-17 22:58 BeelsebobWork    EmielRegis: ReduceToNormalForm (it's in Control.Parallel)
2008-11-17 22:58 geezusfreeek     strategies is really what i meant by `par`. they are probably over a beginner's head though :(
2008-11-17 22:58 EmielRegis       so it would run all the lines in  parallel?
2008-11-17 22:59 geezusfreeek     in implementation at least
2008-11-17 22:59 BeelsebobWork    EmielRegis: parMap will parallelise it, over as many CPUs as you have
2008-11-17 22:59 BeelsebobWork    dynamically
2008-11-17 22:59 EmielRegis       ah
2008-11-17 22:59 EmielRegis       thats nice
2008-11-17 22:59 BeelsebobWork    depending on CPU load

2008-11-17 23:00 BeelsebobWork    so, yeh, then you need to write the renderRow function -- which should actually be simpler than the renderY function
2008-11-17 23:00 BeelsebobWork    because it doesn't have to recurse over your rows

2008-11-18 11:08 Axman6           i still think there's a place for putting like memoisation annotations into the compiler, so you can add a single character, and have it memoised. it would have to be used only where appropriate, and that would be left up to the programmer.
2008-11-18 11:08 Axman6           and i never understood why i got so much negative feedback for saying that :\
2008-11-18 11:09 conal            the naive version is slow (exponential).  the two memo versions are both fast.  the CAF one eats up a lot of memory and doesn't release it.  the non-CAF one releases memory.
2008-11-18 11:09 Axman6           don't those types have to be Int -> Int?
2008-11-18 11:09 conal            if the CAF version is invoked twice from the ghci repl with the same argument, it yields an answer right away.
2008-11-18 11:10 Axman6           i tried changing to Integer -> Integer, but there's no HasTrie instance for Integer
2008-11-18 11:10 conal            oh, btw, i just added a MemoTrie instance for Integer.  will release.
2008-11-18 11:10 Axman6           ah. excellent :)
2008-11-18 11:11 conal            just an oversight.  Int is too small to be useful in this case.

2008-11-18 11:19 lispy            Axman6: Okay.  So the first step is to figure out how the automated translation should work.  Once you've figured that out, we can decide where it's implement, in GHC, as a preprocessor, etc.

2008-11-18 11:20 Axman6           if it used laziness, with the array style that is pretty popular, the the only restrictions would be on the inpits being of type Ix
2008-11-18 11:20 jsn              i'm having some real trouble finding docs on how to check for a function with template haskell
2008-11-18 11:20 wchogg           conal:  With the whole point being that by cutting out the diffE & the snapshotWith (*^) that it'll be a little easier for me to see paper & pencil why the implementation is going funny.
2008-11-18 11:20 jsn              it seems like reify is the way to go
2008-11-18 11:20 Axman6           lispy: yes.. once i learn what template haskell is...
2008-11-18 11:20 jsn              but of course i can not use reify from within GHCi
2008-11-18 11:20 bd_              I don't think anything like TH is needed
2008-11-18 11:20 conal            wchogg: agreed.  same core issue, but simpler.  good idea.
2008-11-18 11:20 bd_              unsafePerformIO however will be needed
2008-11-18 11:20 wchogg           conal:  At the moment, I get to about page 4 of the calculation & it starts getting hard to simplify in any illustrative way.
2008-11-18 11:21 conal            wchogg: ouch!
2008-11-18 11:21 Axman6           bd_: thanks for the link, looks good
2008-11-18 11:21 jsn              what should i expect reify to do if a name is not defined?
2008-11-18 11:21 Saizan_          jsn: tried something like $(reify 'foo >>= stringL . show) ?
2008-11-18 11:21 lispy            Axman6: template haskell is sort of like an elaborate macro system. You can modify the code during a specific stage of compilation to generate other code
2008-11-18 11:21 wchogg           conal:  That's why I was so disappointed I couldn't reproduce it via stepping in ghci
2008-11-18 11:21 newsham          do FieldTrip dependencies run on win32? (ie. opengl and friends) ?
2008-11-18 11:22 conal            wchogg: oh, i see.
2008-11-18 11:22 Axman6           bd_: that's why i think it should be in the compiler, so that you don't have to worry about the IO of it. it will always be a function of f :: a -> ... -> x, no matter if its memoised or not
2008-11-18 11:22 conal            newsham: yes
2008-11-18 11:22 Axman6           just, one will be faster
2008-11-18 11:22 Lemmih           gwern: Can I interest you in an lhc tarball: http://darcs.haskell.org/~lemmih/lhc-20081118.tar.gz ?
2008-11-18 11:22 conal            newsham: i was running reactive & FieldTrip on Win32 a couple of weeks ago.  i think camio still does.
2008-11-18 11:22 Lemmih           gwern: It should work with ghc-6.8.
2008-11-18 11:22 bd_              Axman6: That doesn't need to be in the compiler - just in a library :)
2008-11-18 11:22 newsham          cool, gonna upgrade my ghc and install that stuff
2008-11-18 11:23 Axman6           what i'm proposing would let anyone add a single character to the code, and get memoisation. no worrying about IO or anything like that
2008-11-18 11:23 jsn              Saizan_: Couldn't match expected type `Q Exp' against inferred type `Lit'
2008-11-18 11:23 bd_              Axman6: a single character might be pushing it for a library - but memoization isn't actually something you want all that often - trading memory for CPU isn't always a good solution :)
2008-11-18 11:24 r0oter           bd_: so u think I can use something like sort, i guess im a bit confused
2008-11-18 11:24 bd_              memo :: Hashable a => (a -> b) -> (a -> b)  would seem reasonable
2008-11-18 11:24 Saizan_          jsn: so it's $(reify 'foo >>= return . LitE . stringL . show), i don't recall the types so well

2008-11-18 11:27 Axman6           hmm, how would i define a class that worked on containers? like, class Blah (n a) where foo :: (n a) -> Integer -> a?

2008-11-18 11:28 bd_              r0oter: Ord includes things that aren't numbers. Thus your return type might not be something that has a zero. (for example, strings, or tuples of orderable objects)

2008-11-18 11:28 bd_              r0oter: So, one thing you can do is instead annotate it (Ord a, Num a) => [...], which will let your code as written work... but it isn't very haskelly to use 0 as a flag
2008-11-18 11:29 jsn              Axman6: the parens are unnecessary
2008-11-18 11:29 bd_              what I'd do is just: f :: [a] -> Maybe a        f (x:_) = Just x         f [] = Nothing
2008-11-18 11:29 jsn              Axman6: define the class and then a great many instances

2008-11-18 11:35 gwern            now there's something which confused me the first time I ran into it
2008-11-18 11:35 r0oter           bd_: f just need to sort and return it on ascendant order

2008-11-18 11:35 Axman6           i need a new infix operator, something along the lines of ! and !!
2008-11-18 11:35 bd_              r0oter: well, you don't need Num in that then - the only reason you need Num is because your incomplete implementation is incorrect
2008-11-18 11:35 bd_              r0oter: f [] = 0 <-- this says f returns a number. Of course, a real sort would not return a number
2008-11-18 11:36 bd_              moreover, your function returns only a single element; if it's to be a sort, it needs to be f :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
2008-11-18 11:36 Axman6           so i couldn't use !#?
2008-11-18 11:36 gwern            'lhc' eh. logical and amusing
2008-11-18 11:36 gwern            (since khc doesn't sound nice)
2008-11-18 11:37 bd_              Axman6: you could in a preprocessor, but it probably wouldn't be merged into GHC proper
2008-11-18 11:37 bd_              I still think a 'memo' function would be cleaner
2008-11-18 11:37 Axman6           i'm not working on the memoisation thing atm

2008-11-18 11:49 newsham          well, i'm running it from cygwin and i noticed that it ran "configure" and detected "cygwin" and this has me worried
2008-11-18 11:49 newsham          that it might be linking against cygwin stuff instead of making "normal" win32 bins

2008-11-18 11:51 lispy            Axman6: if you want, instance Foo (a,a) where ..., you'll need some extensions

2008-11-18 11:52 conal            newsham: first you have to get opengl32.dll and glut32.dll on your system.

2008-11-18 11:56 lispy            Axman6: okay, "n a" in the signature of (!#) makes n have kind * -> *, meaning n takes a type and produces a type

2008-11-18 12:00 conal            does anyone here no about how to catch an 'error' call (or pattern matching fail or undefined).  i know i'd have to catch in IO, for semantic reasons.

2008-11-18 12:38 conal            wchogg: the discussion started with Beelsebob asking about how exceptions played with unamb.  i think the answer is that the implementation is correct w.r.t the semantics.
2008-11-18 12:40 conal            wchogg: then two other questions arose that got me thinking.  (a) is unamb more strictly expressive than parallel-or? and (b) can we loosen unamb's precondition considerably, e.g., to arbitrary non-contradictory values.
2008-11-18 12:40 conal            where non-contradictory means they have a common upper information bound.

2008-11-18 13:16 dmwit            It's probably referring to the Haskell bindings to the X11 libraries.

How might it work in haskell while trying to keep close to the spirit, but doing things in a haskell way? Description can be read here:

2008-11-18 15:13 cjs              So you could just use the Haskell equivalants of the C# synchronization constructs, in which case just look at the library docs for both, or you could try to do the exercise you'd get in the Haskell class, and use STM.
2008-11-18 15:13 chylli           roconnor: sorry, I don't know what's the mean :(
2008-11-18 15:13 roconnor         <dmwit_> roconnor, chylli: But evaluate does exactly what you want.

2008-11-18 15:15 jdrake_          I am not sure there is any value in using haskell equivalents, because such a translation sounds like lunacy to me.
2008-11-18 15:15 jsn              is there a way, within cabal, to check the version of template haskell that is available and conditionally set a CPP flag?
2008-11-18 15:15 cjs              jdrake_: Well, either way, just read up on the stuff available in Control.Concurrent and chose what looks good to you. For extra credit, do it several different ways.

2008-11-21 20:53 quicksilver      in a sense that wouldn't be a single function though.
2008-11-21 20:53 jsn              a good example is print (Text.Printf in the standard library)
2008-11-21 20:53 quicksilver      it would be a typeclass polymorphic function which is a family of functions.
2008-11-21 20:53 quicksilver      but yes.
2008-11-21 20:53 jsn              quicksilver: sure, but it would present a uniform interface
2008-11-21 20:54 jsn              askentask: haskell makes "single dispatch" on the _result_ type easy-peasy
2008-11-21 20:54 ski_             would it work over the infinitude of different tuple types ?
2008-11-21 20:55 jsn              ski_: well, printf does that, right?
2008-11-21 20:55 ski_             not that i recall
2008-11-21 20:55 jsn              ski_: it's not tuples but varargs
2008-11-21 20:55 quicksilver      nothing works over the infinitude of tuple types
2008-11-21 20:55 quicksilver      since the tuple types have nothing in common
2008-11-21 20:55 quicksilver      they are just distinct types.
2008-11-21 20:55 jsn              right
2008-11-21 20:55 jsn              but zip could be done with varargs, like printf
2008-11-21 20:56 ski_             `printf' "finally" returns a `String'
2008-11-21 20:56 BONUS            i think ziplists are fine
2008-11-21 20:56 quicksilver      it couldn't return a list of tuples
2008-11-21 20:56 ski_             what would `zipN' "finally" return ?
2008-11-21 20:56 quicksilver      which is what zip does
2008-11-21 20:56 jsn              ah, wait, damn
2008-11-21 20:56 jsn              you are right
2008-11-21 20:56 jsn              curses
2008-11-21 20:56 quicksilver      it could return a list of lists.
2008-11-21 20:56 jsn              it'd have to return a list of lists
2008-11-21 20:56 quicksilver      but that imposes a different type restriction.
2008-11-21 20:56 jsn              yes
2008-11-21 20:57 ski_             or a list of `(a,(b,(..(z,())..)))'
2008-11-21 20:57 quicksilver      /action nods
2008-11-21 20:57 jsn              ski_: which would not be so bad
2008-11-21 20:57 luite_           until you need to get the fst.snd.fst.fst.snd element ;)
2008-11-21 20:57 luite_           oh wait :)
2008-11-21 20:58 luite_           it would be more an iterate snd
2008-11-21 20:58 jsn              basically, that is like having a fixed length cons list
2008-11-21 20:58 ski_             hm .. maybe we should hype using balanced binary trees for simulating general tuples in a structural way, instead of that "church numeral" representation
2008-11-21 20:59 bos              /join 
2008-11-21 20:59 quicksilver      jsn: it is, roughly, what HList is.
2008-11-21 20:59 jsn              so, i bet you we could have polymorphic zip for the 17 tuple types
2008-11-21 20:59 jsn              and it would satisfy most everybody
2008-11-21 21:02 jsn              ski_: i understand what you meant now, about the tuple types
2008-11-21 21:02 jsn              for some reason i thought you meant a tuple of lists
2008-11-21 21:02 ski_             hm .. so maybe given a natural number, represented as a positional binary numeral, in types, we would have a type-class derive the appropriate shape of the balanced tree, plus handling accessors, et.c. ..

2008-11-21 21:04 sclv             ZipLists are one of the motivating examples for applicatives --being more than a functor but less than a monad.
2008-11-21 21:05 ski_             sclv : good find !
2008-11-21 21:05 quicksilver      ZipLists are a monad actually.
2008-11-21 21:05 quicksilver      unless I misremember.

2008-11-21 21:06 ski_             right, istr that
2008-11-21 21:06 quicksilver      so interesting, [a] is technicaly only a monad for finite lists
2008-11-21 21:06 quicksilver      and ZipList a is technically only a monad for infinite lists
2008-11-21 21:06 quicksilver      so they are actually *not* an example of two different monad structures on the same data type.

2008-11-21 21:45 ski_             lilac : the problem with finite `ZipList's had, iirc, to do with taking diagonal in the two ways `join . join' vs. `join . fmap join' in an infinite "cube" .. problem being that taking diagonals perpendicular to one axis can lose more values that doing it the other way
2008-11-21 21:45 ski_             lilac : in the above example `6' is "lost"

2008-11-21 21:59 quicksilver      so really it's a question of letting standard usages evolve and getting used to them.
2008-11-21 22:00 FunctorSalad     I think utf-8 actually works if you use parentheses
2008-11-21 22:00 quicksilver      it works without parentheses.

2008-11-21 22:43 Peaker           hmm.. Its unlike Haskell to have theoretically-unsound stuff like arrow extensions that "assume" (or hand-wave away) their incompatibility with "arr" (Reading the bidirectional arrow paper..)

2008-11-21 22:44 Peaker           Maybe with class aliases, the arrow classes can be rehauled to make more sense

2008-11-21 22:48 xenoblitz        hi guys... I was wondering if anyone ever used a type class to be able to define a higher order function which is able to handle functions of varying arity
2008-11-21 22:48 Peaker           <Peakerbot> forall a b. (a->b) -> [a] -> [b]

2008-11-21 22:48 SamB             not sure.
2008-11-21 22:48 xenoblitz        for example

2008-11-21 22:52 quicksilver      xenoblitz: isn't that just simulate (a -> TypeA) a ?

2008-11-21 22:56 Peaker           orbitz: also, code that you write that uses generic classes like Functor will be useful for all the Functors in existence (there are plenty!) rather than be specific to some type
2008-11-21 22:56 orbitz           could i use fmap to do that over a [Maybe a]?
2008-11-21 22:56 Peaker           orbitz: yes,  fmap.fmap  maps over [Maybe a]
2008-11-21 22:56 Twey             orbitz: That would be fmap . fmap

2008-11-21 22:56 quicksilver      xenoblitz: and why you can't just use simulate :: (a -> TypeA) -> a -> whatever...
2008-11-21 22:57 Peaker           orbitz: for every Functor that "Wraps" your value, you can compose another fmap to "penetrate" the wrapper and access the value inside
2008-11-21 22:57 quicksilver      but then, I'm not sure what you're trying to do.
2008-11-21 22:57 mgdtgd           I'm looking for a simple, elegant solution to pretty printing a binary tree
2008-11-21 22:57 quicksilver      xenoblitz: quicksilver's rule 1 : If you think you want a typeclass, think again.
2008-11-21 22:57 Twey             orbitz: It's like liftM, but for Functors.  :)
2008-11-21 22:57 xenoblitz        lilac: thanks but that's complex for me :/
2008-11-21 22:57 geezusfreeek     mgdtgd: deriving Show ;)
2008-11-21 22:58 lilac            xenoblitz: as quicksilver says, you probably don't /want/ to do that, but you /can/...
2008-11-21 22:58 mgdtgd           geezusfreeek: _pretty_ printing
2008-11-21 22:58 xenoblitz        ok let me give you my context
2008-11-21 22:58 xenoblitz        imagine you are using haskell for circuits...
2008-11-21 22:58 xenoblitz        some gates have 1 input
2008-11-21 22:58 xenoblitz        some have 2
2008-11-21 22:58 mgdtgd           by pretty printing I mean: every node sits between its children, one line above them
2008-11-21 22:58 xenoblitz        for example
2008-11-21 22:58 xenoblitz        and you want to simulate them
2008-11-21 22:58 orbitz           what does liftM do?
2008-11-21 22:58 geezusfreeek     mgdtgd: i was just being silly
2008-11-21 22:58 SamB             xenoblitz: you could use tuples ;-P
2008-11-21 22:58 lilac            xenoblitz: you're modelling them as functions?
2008-11-21 22:58 xenoblitz        yes
2008-11-21 22:58 Peaker           orbitz: liftM = fmap
2008-11-21 22:59 xenoblitz        example
2008-11-21 22:59 jpcooper         orbitz, applies a function to the contents of a monadic value
2008-11-21 22:59 SamB             (that's the way Lava did it in one life ...)
2008-11-21 22:59 lilac            xenoblitz: why not 'not :: Expr -> Expr', 'nand :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr', etc...
2008-11-21 22:59 xenoblitz        SamB: yes :P
2008-11-21 22:59 geezusfreeek     but i must go, so no time to discuss pretty printing, sorry

2008-11-21 22:59 xenoblitz        yes lilac
2008-11-21 22:59 orbitz           are liftM and fmap exactly the same?
2008-11-21 22:59 mgdtgd           I need to program it myself
2008-11-21 22:59 Yoric[DT]        /join 
2008-11-21 23:00 xenoblitz        then how do you simulate an orG or an andG with just one function
2008-11-21 23:00 Peaker           orbitz: The class hierarchy *should* have been: Functors => Applicatives => Monads  but due to unfortunate historical reasons, it isn't.  Since Monad is more expressive than Functor/Applicative, you can express all of their methods with just the monadic (return, >>=)
2008-11-21 23:00 mgdtgd           it's a kind of homework, just not mine. But I need to explain it to others
2008-11-21 23:00 SamB             orbitz: they should always be identical whenever they occur at the same type, yes
2008-11-21 23:00 mgdtgd           so it would be good to know the solution myself
2008-11-21 23:00 Peaker           orbitz: the expression of fmap is called liftM, that of <*> is called ap, that of pure is called return
2008-11-21 23:00 quicksilver      mgdtgd: read the paper reference in the docs of Text.PrettyPrint
2008-11-21 23:00 mgdtgd           are they suitable for beginners?
2008-11-21 23:00 mgdtgd           it's a CS 101 course
2008-11-21 23:00 Peaker           orbitz: if Monad subclassed Applicative as it should have, we wouldn't need that duality
2008-11-21 23:00 quicksilver      read it and let me know.
2008-11-21 23:00 SamB             mgdtgd: beginning readers or ?
2008-11-21 23:01 Peaker           orbitz: we also have sequence VS. sequenceA and others :-(
2008-11-21 23:01 SamB             Peaker: now, now
2008-11-21 23:01 SamB             how could it have ?
2008-11-21 23:01 SamB             Applicative was invented second!
2008-11-21 23:01 lilac            xenoblitz: i'm not sure i understand the question. you can write and a b = not $ nand a b; or a b = nand (not a) (not b)
2008-11-21 23:01 Peaker           SamB: class aliases and less backwards compatibility :)
2008-11-21 23:01 SamB             it's Functor that it has no excuse for not subclassing
2008-11-21 23:02 SamB             Peaker: well, you might notice that nobody has implemented those
2008-11-21 23:02 Twey             mgdtgd: You'd have better luck doing it horizontally
2008-11-21 23:02 xenoblitz        lilac: I used that .... sort of simulate $ andG true false for example
2008-11-21 23:02 SamB             JHC can parse them but that's about it ...
2008-11-21 23:02 xenoblitz        but i want a higher order function... :P
2008-11-21 23:02 Twey             With a straight line across the top, starting in the top left corner and branching down
2008-11-21 23:03 Twey             That's the only solution of which I can think that can be done lazily
2008-11-21 23:03 orbitz           Peaker, SamB thanks, i'm sure i'll be back for more since i didn't quite follow all of that
2008-11-21 23:03 mgdtgd           I thought of a complicated way using BFS. But that's too complicated
2008-11-21 23:03 lilac            Peaker: i don't think the class heirarchy is that clear cut. Functor => Pointed, Function => Applicative, (Arrow, Pointed, Applicative) => Monad. but that'd be a complete pain
2008-11-21 23:03 Twey             (and simply)
2008-11-21 23:03 Peaker           orbitz: basically a Functor is a value[s] "container" that allows you to modify the contained value[s] while its still inside.  An Applicative is a "container" that allows you to run a pure function/computation using multiple containers as input (combining multiple contained results in one computation)
2008-11-21 23:03 SamB             Twey: what about the line going down the left ?
2008-11-21 23:04 lilac            Peaker: and there are many more 'base' classes you might want to add to Monad. I think the haskell approach to this issue is /far/ from perfect
2008-11-21 23:04 Gilly            /join 
2008-11-21 23:04 quicksilver      lilac: My experience is that Functor, Applicative and Monad are very commonly useful :)
2008-11-21 23:04 Peaker           lilac: that's even more fine-grained, and might be better, maybe it is possible with class alises?
2008-11-21 23:04 quicksilver      lilac: and that POinted is not.
2008-11-21 23:04 quicksilver      lilac: I think F > A > M would be far better than what we have now.
2008-11-21 23:04 quicksilver      even if not perfect.

2008-11-21 23:04 SamB             lilac: well, we aren't going to give up just because we are far from perfect
2008-11-21 23:05 Peaker           orbitz: and a Monad is like "Applicative" except it allows you to "dynamically" choose which container to combine based on contained values (applicative makes you choose which containers to choose without looking at any contained values)
2008-11-21 23:05 Twey             Ends up being variable-height, though
2008-11-21 23:05 LFH              /part #haskell "Leaving"
2008-11-21 23:05 lilac            quicksilver: i don't disagree. however, i think a better language would allow the author of Pointed to say 'all Monads are Pointeds' without losing the ability to say 'this non-Monad is Pointed'
2008-11-21 23:05 Twey             Hard to format
2008-11-21 23:05 xenoblitz        I guess no one can help me with this... still thanks all the same :)
2008-11-21 23:05 SamB             we have to approach perfection by stopping in the places we can actually find that seem like they might be on the way
2008-11-21 23:05 SamB             you know ?
2008-11-21 23:06 SamB             Twey: what's wrong with variable height ?
2008-11-21 23:06 Peaker           lilac, quicksilver: Wouldn't class aliases allow us to have high-granularity classes like Pointed without giving away convenience?
2008-11-21 23:06 orbitz           Peaker: hrm ok
2008-11-21 23:06 SamB             isn't variable width worse ?
2008-11-21 23:06 Peaker           orbitz: its probably clearer if examples are used :)
2008-11-21 23:06 orbitz           Peaker: i think it would be :) suggested reading?
2008-11-21 23:07 SamB             Peaker: well, you'd still have to incorporate the hierarchy changes in the code for the classes that need to be subclasses ...
2008-11-21 23:07 lilac            sometimes i wonder if things'd be better if typeclasses were allowed only one member, with another concept (say Axiom) to represent rules about combinations thereof. that and aliases to save typing and make error messages nicer
2008-11-21 23:07 Peaker           orbitz: there's "the" paper about arrows, applicatives and monads, but I can't read it (too much math notation for me)...

2008-11-21 23:09 Twey             Which is why, since the items are variable-width, it's better to do it with the line across the top
2008-11-21 23:09 Twey             That way they don't have to go next to one another, they have to go beneath one another

2008-11-21 23:11 Peaker           I think conal's Behavior is one, but it "should" be a Monad
2008-11-21 23:12 conal            agreed.
2008-11-21 23:12 Peaker           I keep thinking that the Arrow-based optimized context-free parser could have been an Applicative-based parser, to serve as a good example
2008-11-21 23:12 conal            my favorite Applicative example is a UI

2008-11-21 23:13 quicksilver      I also don't know of any good examples of things which are Applicative but not Monad, except for the s-d parser.

2008-11-21 23:14 quicksilver      and Behaviour, as you said, but I don't think that counts.
2008-11-21 23:15 conal            Peaker: oh yeah.  phooey style UI is a monad, but TV-style isn't, and i think can't be.
2008-11-21 23:15 conal            and the TV style (also Eros style) is much more functional/composable
2008-11-21 23:15 Peaker           conal: come to think of it, Phooey style UI has just a result, not a "current result", so it being a monad does not really mean the UI is any more dynamic, right?
2008-11-21 23:17 quicksilver      conal: TV style isn't Applicative though is it?

2008-11-21 23:19 Peaker           conal: heh :-)
2008-11-21 23:19 quicksilver      well parsec is a perfectly well behaved instance of applicative, but that doesn't make it magically optimise :)
2008-11-21 23:19 conal            sry.  i think there's something about Applicative, non-monadic UIs, but i can't seem to pull it out right now.
2008-11-21 23:20 quicksilver      the point is rather than by providing only an applicative instance, you open up other implementation ppossibilities - and these possibilities forbid a sensible monad instance.

2008-11-21 23:22 quicksilver      lilac: the S-D parser is an applicative parser with approximately that property.
2008-11-21 23:23 quicksilver      it can be converted to next-symbol-lookup tables at compile time.
2008-11-21 23:23 lilac            i didn't realise applicative was restrictive enough for that :)
2008-11-21 23:23 Peaker           I guess the inability to choose which results to combine based on those results really sums up to either A) A performance decision (you need the information sooner to optimize)  B) A case where you were forced to choose which results to combine earlier
2008-11-21 23:23 conal            oh -- i think i remember the issue about Phooey.  I wanted a slider input widget to have type 'UI Float' (or 'UI Int').  I could get that type in the applicative approach, while in the monadic approach the best i could do was a type like 'UI (Behavior Float)'.
2008-11-21 23:23 quicksilver      lilac: you should read the paper it's great.

2008-11-21 23:35 quicksilver      although some people find the stacatto nature of do block code rather annoying
2008-11-21 23:35 quicksilver      and so there has been a trend towards combinators instead.
2008-11-21 23:35 Giraffe          right
2008-11-21 23:35 quicksilver      nothing wrong with a do block if it's the best way to express a problem clearly, IMO.

2008-11-22 18:08 Peaker           Taejo: the applicative style of a <$> b <*> c <*> d ... is less composable in this sense:  (liftA2.liftA2.liftA2)
2008-11-22 18:09 pumpkin          so I should go for liftA2 over <*> ?
2008-11-22 18:10 pumpkin          it looks kinda purty right now with all those <*>s
2008-11-22 18:10 dmwit            no
2008-11-22 18:10 dmwit            Go with purty.
2008-11-22 18:10 Lanjiao          Peaker: it works, but why?
2008-11-22 18:11 Peaker           Lanjiao: I don't know
2008-11-22 18:11 int-e            Peaker: because Main is the default module name
2008-11-22 18:11 Peaker           pumpkin: <*> is fine, but I was just mentioning my perceived advantage of the lift shortcuts

2008-11-22 18:26 int-e            Peaker: yes that's the problem. if you compile the module without -main-is and then try to link with -main-is, linking will fail

2008-11-22 18:30 Lanjiao          Peaker: I think the reason I failed before with -main-is is that as int-e said: if you compile the module without -main-is and then try to link with -main-is, linking will fail
2008-11-22 18:30 int-e            Peaker: so what GHC actually does is add an artificial :Main (with a leading colon) module interface to a module when compiling, if the module name matches the -main-is option.

2008-11-22 18:43 dmwit            Well, without knowing a bit more about Parser, it's really impossible to say.
2008-11-22 18:43 sm               I have Parser (IO UTCTime) right now, but that's just a guess
2008-11-22 18:44 dmwit            You can make that work.
2008-11-22 18:44 dmwit            But you shouldn't.
2008-11-22 18:44 sm               I think Parser is Parsec's synonym
2008-11-22 18:44 dmwit            You should make a ParserT that can wrap any monad.
2008-11-22 18:44 dmwit            Then it would be ParserT IO UTCTime.
2008-11-22 18:44 dmwit            (notice no parens)

2008-11-22 18:45 dmwit            Well... it's probably going to be just as difficult to thread first-class IO actions as it is to just deal with the threading up front.

2008-11-22 18:46 laziest          dmwit: so can you combine state and IO for instance?
2008-11-22 18:46 dmwit            laziest: You should note that, for example, "getLine" does not, by itself, get a line; it's merely a description of an action that gets a line.
2008-11-22 18:46 dmwit            laziest: Yes.
2008-11-22 18:46 dmwit            laziest: In particular, this means you can pass IO actions around, return them from other IO actions, repeat IO actions, ...
2008-11-22 18:46 sm               aren't there some examples of these common transformers somewhere ?

2008-11-22 21:07 Beelsebob_       it's very nice to be able to <*> an image of transformations over an image of pixels for example

2008-11-23 21:09 thoughtpolice    /action has lots of stuff he would like to clean up...
2008-11-23 21:09 Phyx-            a would be a constructor, either Foo or Rec, the int is the number of arguments it has, and b is the result of when i apply the constructor to it's arguments. but in case of Foo i just make the argyment an int and pass it, in case of Rec i have to recursively apply f to the arguments
2008-11-23 21:09 lispy            Phyx-: the quick answer is that if you need type reflection, you probably want Data.Typeable, but please continue your example it's interesting
2008-11-23 21:10 Phyx-            but i want to pass arbitrairy constructors, aslong as they're from the same data type
2008-11-23 21:10 lispy            Phyx-: so the type of b is dependent on a and the value of Int?
2008-11-23 21:11 Phyx-            yes
2008-11-23 21:11 lispy            It will be hard to do this in a type safe way, as haskell doesn't have dependent types.  I think you could fake it in this case, if you really want static type safety, FWIW
2008-11-23 21:12 Saizan_          Phyx-: you've to represent the constructors explicitly for that
2008-11-23 21:12 Phyx-            well, i do have a preprocessor in which i construct the argument list, i guess i could just give it the types along

I can give links too...
2008-11-23 21:16 Phyx-            the preprocessor does some other work aswell :P so i can't get rid of it, lol. just generates boring code that i guess i could have done with template haskell or something. yeah, sure link me :)

2008-11-23 22:19 Saizan_          Blah.x is always "module lookup" btw
2008-11-23 22:19 Saizan_          if you want composition you've to add spaces

2008-11-23 22:21 Saizan_          also, are fixities of infix operators to be interpreted as in-grammar?
2008-11-23 22:21 lispy            GHC uses Happy/Alex so, I suspect that Haskell is context-free as a grammar, but maybe it requires conditional lexing?
2008-11-23 22:22 vixey            why does it matter which class the parser is in?
2008-11-23 22:22 lispy            vixey: it determines the tools you can implement it in?
2008-11-23 22:23 Saizan_          lispy: from discussions here no haskell compiler implements the grammar 100% correctly
2008-11-23 22:23 lispy            vixey: and possible by extension the asymptotic complexity of parsing it?
2008-11-23 22:23 lispy            Saizan_: interesting.

2008-11-24 10:11 gwern            plogYy: iirc from when I was editing the wikibook, the haskell wikibook's introductory chapters summarize the basic math

2008-11-24 10:14 gwern            I have no idea. I've only looked through a part of rwh; why not try reading through concurrently, or maybe alternating chapters?
2008-11-24 10:15 dons             the wikibook assumes more, imo.

2008-11-24 10:25 gwern            chessguy: I wanted to be as far away from the machine as possible - haskell did not only gc, but I didn't even have to specify evaluation order

2008-11-24 13:45 cjs              The latter seems to make the most sense from many points of view, but ends up adding more boilerplate.

2008-11-26 22:50 m4dnificent      Hello, I'm learning haskell here (at school).  I have created a class Sequentie, which declares some methods.  Now I wanted to instantiate this class for all instantiations of Enum.  I tried something like: instance (Enum a) => Sequentie a where ... but apparantly this isn't valid

2008-11-26 22:52 m4dnificent      I've tried to search the answer on wikibooks and asked it to the one teaching me, but neither could provide me with an answer (the teacher didn't know the answer, and it isn't really homework).  Therefore, I'm trying my luck here.

2008-11-27 09:38 Cale             lispy: Okay, I can try to explain better. Typeclass polymorphism lets you implement ad-hoc polymorphism, by defining typeclasses which have a type variable, and a single method which is totally polymorphic, and always specifying a monomorphic type whenever you use the method.

2008-11-27 09:44 lispy            C++ has parametric polymorphism with lazy implicit constraints
2008-11-27 09:44 dolio            Yeah, and they're making it even closer to typeclass polymorphism in the new standard.
2008-11-27 09:44 Cale             lispy: For me, ad-hoc polymorphism is the sort of polymorphism where you implement a value once for each monomorphic type at which you want to be able to instantiate it, and every occurrence of it must be monomorphic.
2008-11-27 09:44 luqui            lispy, that is a very kind way of putting it :-)
2008-11-27 09:45 luqui            dolio, C++'s "concepts" are better than typeclasses in some ways, since they don't have to worry about decidability of type inference

2008-11-27 09:45 Cale             That is, instance selection is dependent on type, like with typeclass polymorphism, but ad-hoc polymorphism doesn't have a way to say "I'm polymorphic because I use polymorphic things"

2008-11-27 09:47 luqui            povman, it would be pretty boring.  it's awful flat

2008-11-27 10:08 kynky            i guess undefined /= undefined from certain aspects
2008-11-27 10:08 luqui            what!
2008-11-27 10:08 luqui            undefined == undefined.  you just can't decide it.

2008-11-27 10:09 StoneToad        lol

2008-11-27 10:10 oklopol          but i'd say it makes sense if you have some kinda identity on objects, and 0/0 is equal to the "same" 0/0, but not some other 0/0 . in haskell i just wouldn't have undefinitedness

2008-11-27 10:15 gwern            so, what's the difference  between a 'let foo =' and a 'foo <-' in a do expression?

2008-11-27 10:16 luqui            dolio, yeah true...  on the other hand mathematicians have to provide such proofs every time they divide
2008-11-27 10:16 EvilTerran       ?undo \x -> do foo:_ <- x; return foo

2008-11-27 10:16 Cale             gwern: let foo = bar  defines foo and bar to be equal,  foo <- bar  defines foo to be the result of executing the action bar.
2008-11-27 10:16 dolio            You'd have to do actual work proving stuff. :)
2008-11-27 10:17 Cale             gwern: You've been here a while, I would think you'd know that :)
2008-11-27 10:17 gwern            Cale: it's just in my do expression, both compile, which confuses me
2008-11-27 10:17 Cale             gwern: Well, foo will have a different type in each case.
2008-11-27 10:17 gwern            I was wondering if they lead to different types but how that worked
2008-11-27 10:18 Cale             If bar :: IO t, then in the first case, foo :: IO t, and in the second, foo :: t.

2008-11-27 10:18 Cale             foo = bar means that foo and bar are the same action

2008-11-27 11:00 Cale             It doesn't really bother me.
2008-11-27 11:00 ksf              in fact, it's the best example of why the excluded middle is nonsense in general that i've ever seen.
2008-11-27 11:00 Cale             As a formalist, P or (not P) is just an axiom of the way that our logic works.
2008-11-27 11:01 Cale             It might be impossible to form a proof for P or a proof for not P
2008-11-27 11:01 ksf              so, what if P doesn't terminate?
2008-11-27 11:01 Cale             But the statement that P or not P is still true.
2008-11-27 11:01 Cale             "Doesn't terminate"?
2008-11-27 11:01 ksf              ...that you can't form a proof for it.
2008-11-27 11:01 Cale             P is a finite string of symbols.
2008-11-27 11:02 ksf              i tend to see stuff from the computational perspective.
2008-11-27 11:02 Cale             Well, the appropriate way to map this logic stuff on to computation is that propositions are types, and proofs are programs.
2008-11-27 11:03 Cale             It's not easy to see this, but the law of excluded middle is in some sense equivalent to having call/cc.
2008-11-27 11:05 dolio            Can you prove excluded middle from Pierce's law, and vice versa?

2008-11-27 11:18 dolio            Not sure why the other way doesn't work.

2008-11-27 11:19 ksf              the problem with that is that M can't be a or not a, it's both, always.
2008-11-27 11:19 ksf              at least in potentia.
2008-11-27 11:19 ksf              you can always pull the plug or don't have enough memory.
2008-11-27 11:19 ksf              or, put differently, it's neither nor.
2008-11-27 11:20 ksf              it doesn't really matter as long as you're always painfully aware of when the excluded middle is involved.
2008-11-27 11:20 ksf              there be dragons.
2008-11-27 11:21 Cale             ksf: Taking the categorical logic perspective, we can view statements as a category, with a unique arrow A -> B when A entails B logically. The initial object 0 acts like "false" and terminal object 1 acts as "true". We can take an arbitrary statement A to be true if there is an arrow 1 -> A, and false if there is an arrow A -> 0. The exponential object B^A acts as the statement "A implies B", and given an arrow 1 ->
2008-11-27 11:21 Cale             0^A, we can get an arrow A -> 0. LEM is the assertion that there be an arrow 1 -> A + 0^A, where + is coproduct.
2008-11-27 11:22 Cale             This does not guarantee that there's an arrow 1 -> A or A -> 0 for all A.
2008-11-27 11:22 Cale             (*that* would be the same as saying that the logic is complete)
2008-11-27 11:23 ksf              1 -> A -> 0 *hummm*
2008-11-27 11:24 ksf              so it's basically saying that the excluded middle might be true, but doesn't need to.
2008-11-27 11:24 ksf              which is fine for my tastes.
2008-11-27 11:25 Cale             Well, in categorical logic, which is general enough to handle both cases.
2008-11-27 11:25 Cale             LEM is nice though.
2008-11-27 11:25 ksf              can you point me to a paper that includes such stuff?

2008-11-27 12:02 timthelion       Like have my executable be a haskell program that linked into the gui, then would call the C function, draw gui.  But then how would I do events...
2008-11-27 12:02 povman           timthelion: yes. look at the FFI documentation. you can export haskell functions as C ones
2008-11-27 12:03 timthelion       povman: ooh, that would be interesting.
2008-11-27 12:03 Cale             I suppose you could...

2008-11-27 12:03 povman           yeah it's like

2008-11-27 12:04 povman           then you suddenly get access to name_in_c in your C programs

2008-11-27 12:04 timthelion       povman: interesting.  I'm wondering if I can mix haskell and c in the same file then...

2008-11-27 12:04 povman           oh no
2008-11-27 12:04 Cale             You have to initialise the haskell runtime from C as well, don't forget.

2008-11-27 12:04 Cale             and you have to compile your C program using GHC.

2008-11-27 12:07 Cale             timthelion: To be honest, I would really just build a GUI using glade and gtk2hs. It works well.

2008-11-27 12:08 povman           sorry yeah i got carried away. i just got sdl working the other day and it was exciting.

2008-11-27 12:08 timthelion       That was wxpython.  But my program takes 1.5 secconds to start, and has a very hackish audio backend.
2008-11-27 12:09 Cale             There might be a bit of a difference between the way that GTK apps look on windows and native windows apps, but it's not so bad, and you'll have a bit of that with any cross platform GUI library.
2008-11-27 12:09 acidjnk          /join 
2008-11-27 12:09 timthelion       Now how big is GTK statically linked?
2008-11-27 12:13 timthelion       I'm actually not yet a real haskell programmer yet.  But this program is simple.  You press a button to add a recording to a list, and another button to add a recording to the first recording, as if that first recording was a directory.  Making for a file/directory duality...  Kind of makes using a purely functional langauge pointless, as every single function does a file opperation.
2008-11-27 12:13 povman           and it ran slow?
2008-11-27 12:13 timthelion       Yes, quite.
2008-11-27 12:13 timthelion       Just loading a window with 10 buttons, in wxpython takes more than a seccond.
2008-11-27 12:14 povman           were you running while(1); at the time?
2008-11-27 12:14 timthelion       I don't have a really fast computer, but loading a dillo window, which uses www.fltk.org takes less than that.
2008-11-27 12:15 timthelion       Dillo is almost instant, so I considure this to be unacceptable.
2008-11-27 12:15 povman           yeah. can we see the code which took 10 seconds to load?
2008-11-27 12:15 povman           er ... 1

2008-11-27 12:20 timthelion       The program is in a lot of files, but the main gui is small.  I actually have a 2 seccond dellay in it, because I'm starting a deamon.  But without the deamon, it's just as slow...
2008-11-27 12:20 timthelion       http://hpaste.org/12419
2008-11-27 12:20 povman           i've seen some really fast python programs, so something sounds fishy already
2008-11-27 12:20 timthelion       The slowness is in that xrc call, which loads the xml file gui.
2008-11-27 12:20 timthelion       and also in the loading of python itself.  the program python takes a quarter of a seccond for the simplest program possible.
2008-11-27 12:20 povman           oh. that'd be why.
2008-11-27 12:20 povman           what happens if you compile it first?
2008-11-27 12:20 timthelion       what?
2008-11-27 12:20 povman           the XML thing
2008-11-27 12:20 timthelion       I havn't tried that.

2008-11-27 12:23 lament           timthelion: so no matter how much you optimize this program, it will still take at least 2 seconds to load?
2008-11-27 12:24 Cale             timthelion: Does it run reasonably quickly once it's loaded?
2008-11-27 12:24 Cale             2 seconds is really not *that* long
2008-11-27 12:25 lament           wars have been won in less than that.
2008-11-27 12:25 lament           (well, no. The shortest war so far was 40min)

2008-11-27 12:25 povman           also you might notice that you have a time.sleep(2)
2008-11-27 12:25 timthelion       Cale: It's unacceptably long. If it took you two secconds to say a word, would you talk?
2008-11-27 12:25 timthelion       povman: I mentioned that it's just as slow without.
2008-11-27 12:26 Cale             timthelion: Let's put it this way: is 2 seconds multiplied by the number of times this program is going to be run shorter or longer than it will take to optimise it? :)
2008-11-27 12:28 timthelion       Cale: That still is an invalid point, because 2 secconds multiplied by EVERY program I run is a lot of time.  And if EVERY programmer optimized their code, then more people would use computers, because computers could do more, faster.

2008-11-27 12:30 povman           you probably won't get any speed improvements by moving the same design to a different language

2008-11-27 12:30 Cale             timthelion: But if you look at specific programs, then it's a different story :)
2008-11-27 12:30 lament           if every programmer optimized their code, then overall code quality would be much lower than it is now, leading to even poorer maintainability, leading to buggier and less featureful software, leading to fewer people using computers
2008-11-27 12:31 povman           my computer takes a couple of minutes from power-on until it's fully usable, but i continue doing that every day
2008-11-27 12:32 timthelion       povman: Well this quarter, I stopped.  I can't wait 2 minutes at the start of class, my professor is talking when I walk in.  But I can't keep my computer on througghout the day because of lack of battery life.  I just plain stopped taking notes, and I bulishit the exam essays and get a better score with google than I did with notes.
2008-11-27 12:32 ivan             people who really worry about startup times keep applications running and never reboot

2008-11-27 12:36 timthelion       lament: I can't sequence complex movement and think at the same time.

2008-11-27 12:38 povman           i think the point was that 2 seconds startup time doesn't matter. i regularly wait 2 seconds for a program to load, eg safari or textmate

2008-11-27 13:02 dolio            Lexing is what you used to do before people invented parser combinators, and decided that it was just part of the parser.

2008-11-27 13:08 dons             regexes are often the basis of lexing
2008-11-27 13:08 joed             dolio: Ruby is over 12 years old and Groovy barely has a book?

2008-11-27 13:10 joed             dolio: Heh, as I make my living coding Java, it is a strongly typed C like language that is overly verbose, most of the time I get it to do what I need, if not I write a lib.
2008-11-27 13:10 MikeMayer        dons:  yes sir

2008-11-27 13:16 ksf              haskell's syntax is as easy as perls, but instead of feeding it braindumps, you gotta feed it mathematical papers.

2008-11-27 13:16 MikeMayer        lol
2008-11-27 13:16 dons             i  think people are more comfortable with diverse syntax now. new languages are all over the place syntax wise.
2008-11-27 13:17 dons             ruby /= python /= perl /= C++ /= erlang /= haskell /= ocaml.
2008-11-27 13:17 lament           those aren't languages (except for c++). Those are scripts!

2008-11-27 13:18 lament           they're scripts because they don't have enough curly braces and semicolons.

2008-11-27 13:52 travisbrady      Cale: wouldn't i still have to do that in an action though?  if i'm passing a StdGen that is
2008-11-27 13:52 Cale             travisbrady: No, you would have a plain function with StdGen as one of the parameters.

2008-11-27 13:57 setuid_w00t      ksf: I had the direction of the Y axis mixed up in my head, so when I had two points that were vertically aligned, I was specifying them in the wrong order.
2008-11-27 13:57 Cale             and if that's just a missing newline, return in the middle of a do-block doesn't do anything

2008-11-27 14:01 Cale             In this case, too little, perhaps
2008-11-27 14:01 Cale             But that doesn't fix the problem... it just changes it...
2008-11-27 14:02 Cale             Maybe you don't want the return at all.
2008-11-27 14:02 Cale             after all, it seems like you don't want the result to be another action
2008-11-27 14:02 Cale             after removing the returns, it typechecks
2008-11-27 14:03 Cale             hmm,  return reverse acc
2008-11-27 14:03 Cale             that can't be right.
2008-11-27 14:04 Cale             (though it typechecks, in the function monad)
2008-11-27 14:04 travisbrady      can you give me an example of passing the StdGen into a pure function?
2008-11-27 14:04 Cale             sure
2008-11-27 14:04 ksf              function monad?
2008-11-27 14:05 Cale             ksf: Remind me to explain in a bit :)
2008-11-27 14:05 Cale             I'm just going to whip up a short example.
2008-11-27 14:05 ivanm            Cale: another instant  tutorial? :p
2008-11-27 14:05 travisbrady      oh wow, i rm'd the returns and it DOES typecheck.  but i'm in a do block, i am confused
2008-11-27 14:06 ksf              return does'nt return anything, it injects a value into a monad.
2008-11-27 14:06 ksf              if you already got a monadic value, return isn't what you want.
2008-11-27 14:06 ksf              it should, actually, be called "pure" or something.
2008-11-27 14:06 ksf              "inject" sound good.
2008-11-27 14:07 StoneToad        ksf: shootup?
2008-11-27 14:07 ksf              cale's beloved function monad handles the returning for you, and he'd be eager to explain ;)
2008-11-27 14:08 Cale             I'd normally prefer to say that (return v) is the action which does nothing and returns v.
2008-11-27 14:08 Cale             (in this context)
2008-11-27 14:09 ksf              in my humble terminology, no action actually does anything.
2008-11-27 14:09 Cale             ksf: hm?
2008-11-27 14:09 ksf              it's a real misnomer if you aren't working inside IO
2008-11-27 14:10 Cale             ksf: You can always come up with a meaning for doing.
2008-11-27 14:10 Cale             For instance, in the list monad, executing a list means to pick an element from it in all possible ways,
2008-11-27 14:10 Cale             and in the function monad, executing a function means to apply it to the parameter which is passed in to the whole computation
2008-11-27 14:11 ksf              there we got it.
2008-11-27 14:11 ksf              to me, "function monad" means the thing that specifies the reduction strategy, not appy.
2008-11-27 14:12 ksf              *apply
2008-11-27 14:12 travisbrady      the function monad, i had never heard of such a thing

2008-11-27 14:15 Cale             But it's not unrelated.

2008-11-27 20:44 flux             one thing is a bit suprising with ATS, though: its shootout examples are even longer than C ones :-o
2008-11-27 20:45 thoughtpolice    solrize: it would literally be about 500% better if there were just a few libs for *basic* things, e.g. a basic pthreads wrapper would considerably clean the shootout entries

2008-11-27 20:45 quicksilver      just with some types around them :P
2008-11-27 20:45 flux             so a great type system doesn't come without a cost. or perhaps it only has a little base library.

2008-11-27 20:52 solrize          apparently there is a huge difference vs -XInt that turns off compilation altogether
2008-11-27 20:53 solrize          but i'm sure i get some compilation by default, because this program keeps crashing eclipse unless i build with some special options to turn off compiling certain classes :(
2008-11-27 20:54 p_l              solrize: It's compiled by default, including JIT, but HotSpot recompiles the code over time. afaik it's kind of running a statistical profiler all the time

2008-11-27 21:59 Eelis            given   data A = X | Y deriving Enum   , why can't ghc derive Enum for   data B = Z A   ? it says "Can't make a derived instance of `Enum B' (`B' has non-nullary constructors)", but why should that be a problem? clearly the only possible values are Z X and Z Y, and it seems to me this should be trivially derivable.
2008-11-27 22:00 rog              Zao: is there a canonical form for a character including all associated diacritics?
2008-11-27 22:00 quicksilver      Eelis: in the general case, it can't be done.

2008-11-27 22:01 quicksilver      it would need a more sophisticated scheme than the current one, Eelis
2008-11-27 22:01 quicksilver      Eelis: the current Enum instance has no way of telling if you've "got to the end"
2008-11-27 22:02 quicksilver      (and need to go onto the next constructor)
2008-11-27 22:02 Lemmih           chylli: Well, either install HBase without profiling support or reinstall mtl with profiling support.
2008-11-27 22:02 Eelis            quicksilver: well, personally i'm only interested in the combination (Enum, Bounded) anyway

2008-11-27 22:03 quicksilver      Eelis: yes, it would be possible with a bounded + eq constraint
2008-11-27 22:03 quicksilver      Eelis: (you have to be able to compare against maxBound)

2008-11-29 23:40 Raevel           defun: it depends on a lot of factors
2008-11-29 23:41 Raevel           for instance, if there are competing software with say bsd license, i wouldn't use gpl since then my software would be more restricted in comparison

2008-11-29 23:45 Saizan           alar: you've to compile the Setup.hs with ghc --make, rather than using runghc
2008-11-29 23:46 Raevel           defun: an advantage (or disadvantage) of gpl is that everything it touches becomes gpl, so you could either choose gpl if you want that. If you choose a bsd-compatible license there's the risk that someone forks to gpl and if the fork becomes more popular they have pretty much decided the fate of the software

2008-12-02 21:02 vixey            sjanssen, that worries me because of the number of times cabal has broken and I have not been able to fix it. If cabal takes over it will surely be more complicated and even less chance of me fixing it

2008-12-02 21:02 vixey            dcoutts, no
2008-12-02 21:03 SamB_XP          hmake was some silly thing
2008-12-02 21:03 dcoutts          vixey: well it was an external prog, that did the job of ghc --make
2008-12-02 21:03 SamB_XP          it didn't seem to do much of use
2008-12-02 21:03 sjanssen         vixey: you think you'll have better chances at fixing GHC?
2008-12-02 21:03 dcoutts          plus a couple extras

2008-12-02 21:03 dcoutts          vixey: heh, you're very optimistic :-)
2008-12-02 21:04 SamB_XP          perhaps because no decent Haskell implementations besides GHC and hugs exists ?
2008-12-02 21:04 SamB_XP          (hugs is still the fastest loader around, isn't it?)

2008-12-02 21:05 vixey            if I have a bootstrapped GHC that complied itsself using --make then I am sure --make will work already

2009-01-30 12:59 mm_freak         haskell isn't weird at all, to me it seems much more natural than any other language
2009-01-30 12:59 chessguy         int80_h, ...
2009-01-30 12:59 chessguy         int80_h, you don't need me :)
2009-01-30 12:59 SubStack         aha
2009-01-30 13:00 islon_s          yeah thats what i said
2009-01-30 13:00 SubStack         it seems as though I suck at drawing spheres
2009-01-30 13:00 SubStack         that part was eating up all of the memory
2009-01-30 13:00 chessguy         int80_h, for the record, findFactor does terminate, as long as primeList is finite
2009-01-30 13:00 monochrom        Haskell is the weirdest because it's both academic and successful.
2009-01-30 13:00 SubStack         the slow way uses like 0.9% of memory
2009-01-30 13:00 roconnor         haskell is successful?
2009-01-30 13:00 int80_h          chessguy: well okay I'll just re-write findFactor as a non list comprehension
2009-01-30 13:00 mm_freak         monochrom: good point
2009-01-30 13:00 islon_s          but u have to avoid success anyway so it cant be sucessful
2009-01-30 13:00 chessguy         int80_h, i don't think you have to, but if you want to, have at it
2009-01-30 13:00 int80_h          chessguy: it is supposed to terminate after finding the right answer. it doesn't
2009-01-30 13:00 monochrom        we failed to avoid success.
2009-01-30 13:01 mm_freak         though haskell isn't too academic…  it's just mathematical and mostly used by academics
2009-01-30 13:01 wli              /action had some garbage on hpaste at some point for prime sieves.
2009-01-30 13:01 SubStack         /action looks for some kind of way to destroy glut list thingies
2009-01-30 13:01 monochrom        and Tony Hoare predicted it.
2009-01-30 13:01 roconnor         all the academics moved to Agda
2009-01-30 13:01 islon_s          just because some drunk brazilian guy entered the chanell 3 am it doesnt mean that haskell is sucessful
2009-01-30 13:01 islon_s          or is it?
2009-01-30 13:01 chessguy         int80_h, well as it's written now, it returns a list
2009-01-30 13:02 mm_freak         islon_s: its user base is increasing
2009-01-30 13:02 mm_freak         constantly that is
2009-01-30 13:02 int80_h          chessguy : I want my list to terminate when the right answer is found. Instead of looking for primes it won't find
2009-01-30 13:02 int80_h          as far as I'm concerned, that's a bug
2009-01-30 13:02 chessguy         int80_h, so...you only want the first element of the list?
2009-01-30 13:02 islon_s          i conviced my java-man-boss to learn haskell, after 3 days he still doesnt understand anything
2009-01-30 13:03 Adamant          roconnor: what language are the academics standardizing on now? what happened to Epigram?
2009-01-30 13:03 roconnor         islon_s: give him 3 years
2009-01-30 13:03 wli              Adamant: He just said Agda.
2009-01-30 13:03 int80_h          chessguy: no, I want it to terminate when it finds the largest prime that meets the criteria. It finds that prime, and continues to look for it.
2009-01-30 13:03 monochrom        reddit is a measure of success. or at least fuss. Haskell is a big fuss on reddit, Lisp isn't.
2009-01-30 13:03 roconnor         Adamant: Epigram 2 is for even more hard core people
2009-01-30 13:03 roconnor         it doesn't even exist
2009-01-30 13:03 chessguy         int80_h, how can you possibly know when it's found the largest?
2009-01-30 13:04 roconnor         I'm not sure why Agda 2 is prefered to Epigram.
2009-01-30 13:04 int80_h          chessguy: the largest that meets the criteria
2009-01-30 13:04 monochrom        slashdot is another measure of fuss. they have a "not another haskell post again" tag or department or something.
2009-01-30 13:04 roconnor         I don't know their differences
2009-01-30 13:04 chessguy         int80_h, how can you possibly know when it's found the largest that meets the criteria?

2009-01-30 13:05 int80_h          chessguy: then, I tested this by giving this number to the project euler page, which then confirmed I hasd the right number

2009-01-30 13:57 RichardG_        I have a question about technique.  I have a sequence of operations that are performed.  Each operation results in NoResult or Result a.  I want the sequence to evaluate to the first Result and not process any other operations (logical errors can occur).  Are there any built-in constructs (e.g., specific monads) that do this?

2009-01-30 14:05 Gracenotes       oh, nothing. Seems a bit... niche, maybe?
2009-01-30 14:05 wli              ozy`: Baby steps. Debate each change individually.
2009-01-30 14:05 Gracenotes       you're just doing a little syntactic cleanup here and there, right? e.g., You can't just add a GC and still call it C :)
2009-01-30 14:06 wli              Gracenotes: I'd avoid certain sorts of cleanups.
2009-01-30 14:06 ozy`             wli: I'd still like it to be visually distinct... but yeah
2009-01-30 14:07 wli              Where the syntax really does need to get revised is function types.
2009-01-30 14:07 ozy`             Gracenotes: no GC, no exceptions, in my opinion.... read that how you want :p
2009-01-30 14:07 Gracenotes       to phrase it differently -- how easy or difficult would it be to "translate" between C and your C? Could a machine do it?

2009-01-30 14:10 ozy`             and it still needs to be parseable... LALR(1), certainly, if not LL(1)
2009-01-30 14:11 ozy`             Gracenotes: yes, that's the idea ;)
2009-01-30 14:12 ozy`             Gracenotes: in fact, semantically it should be nearly identical to C except in the cases where C depends on macros and/or the void pointer

2009-01-30 14:13 bd_              FWIW, C++0x has a decent idea of function types. std::function<returntype(args)>
