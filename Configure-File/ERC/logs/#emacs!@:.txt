<consolers> or maybe there is a better political analogy  [15:12:14]
<johnsu01> ggole: yeah, I was using the ascii characters before but now they show as boxes  [15:13:13]
<ggole> johnsu01: I don't think they are valid unicode as is. What I meant is that unicode might have its own code points for them.  [15:14:36]
<ozy`> consolers: common lisp is not exactly terse anyway  [15:14:45]
<ozy`> expressive, yess terse, no  [15:15:06]
<consolers> well the designers know that. but the clueless consumer will still have two conflicting itches to scratch  [15:15:51]
<johnsu01> ggole: I thought I found such things  [15:16:05]
<consolers> the aim of the designer is to trick the victim into thinking he can scratch both itches until the victim gets enlightenment  [15:16:19]
<consolers> or dies whichever comes first  [15:16:48]
<ggole> johnsu01: maybe modern fonts don't support that stuff then  [15:16:50]
<consolers> anyway sun is dead. stanford investments are up for judgement  [15:18:03]
<consolers> targeting jvm is like genera targeting the alpha   [15:18:35]
<consolers> (i'm hopings)  [15:18:57]
<ozy`> the JVM has a huge install base though, and more than enough momentum to be revived if everyone decided to pick up a JVM language tomorrow
                                                                                                                                                [15:20:39]
<consolers> yeah my analogy was flawed from start  [15:21:06]
<consolers> alpha was actually cool architecture and the decision was technically sound  [15:21:20]
<consolers> the only hope of jvm dying is something worse replacing it  [15:22:24]
<consolers> and we have a candidate!  [15:22:35]
<ggole> The CLR?  [15:22:49]
<ozy`> good news then: between desktop and web (ASP) development, the CLR iss yep  [15:22:54]
<redsonya> when you car a list of two strings it out puts the string but when you cdr a the same list is outputs a list of one string.  [15:23:44]
<redsonya> How do you extract the second string.  [15:23:57]
<consolers> cadr  [15:24:05]
<ggole> second  [15:24:09]
<redsonya> thanks  [15:24:11]
<redsonya> either or?  [15:24:16]
<ozy`> IIRC, .NET currently has double the job market share of java  [15:24:22]
<ggole> They are the same function  [15:24:24]
<redsonya> ta1  [15:24:29]
<redsonya> ta  [15:24:35]
<banisterfiend> when i press 'tab' in emacs is it inserting tabs of spaces?   [15:25:37]
<banisterfiend> (when indenting sourcecode)  [15:25:44]
<wolfbone_> banisterfiend, M-x whitespace-mode  [15:26:04]
<ggole> Tab usually runs autoindent, which inserts enough spaces or tabs to make itself happy  [15:26:14]
<ggole> Which it uses depends on indent-tabs-mode  [15:26:25]
<banisterfiend> wolfbone_: no such command as whitespace-mode  [15:26:45]
<banisterfiend> on my emacs  [15:26:48]
<ggole> ,apropos whitespace  [15:27:05]
<fsbot> 28 matches.  (Info-search-whitespace-regexp delete-trailing-whitespace delete-whitespace-rectangle delete-whitespace-rectangle-line
        erbutils-cleanup-whitespace erc-send-whitespace-lines fixup-whitespace forward-whitespace global-whitespace-mode ietf-drums-remove-whitespace
        i[Type ,more]
<ggole> Hmm  [15:27:17]
<wolfbone_> banisterfiend, sry about that - 23 only, I suppose.  [15:27:30]
<banisterfiend> hmm ok  [15:28:04]
<consolers> I  implemented some parts of the hash array mapped tries when i was looking at representing dictionaries for identd  [15:28:07]
<banisterfiend> so how do i find out if it's putting tabs or spaces?  [15:28:12]
<ggole> Look at the value of indent-tabs-mode  [15:28:25]
<consolers> it seemed pretty pointless a datastructure in cl  [15:28:34]
<banisterfiend> M-x indent-tabs-mode ?  [15:28:35]
<ggole> C-h v indent-tabs-mode  [15:28:43]
<ggole> Unless you want to change it, of course  [15:28:53]
<ggole> consolers, unless you are interested in persistence  [15:29:07]
<consolers> i mean the gains were from implementing it  in C  [15:29:09]
<consolers> i'm not sure  [15:30:22]
<consolers> the other ds i was comparing with at that time  was IIRC midatrie  [15:30:53]
<consolers> it was for persistence: a file backed VM layer  [15:31:33]
<banisterfiend> my indents-tab-mode value was non-nil so that means it was putting down tabs? this is a bad thing right? so if i turn it off it'll insert
                spaces instead ?  [15:31:35]
<ggole> Yes, more or less  [15:32:00]
<ggole> (indentation won't use tabs to indent an amount that is less than tab-width, but that's not so common)  [15:32:26]
<banisterfiend> ok cool  [15:33:18]
<banisterfiend> the default is that it's on right? so that it usees tabs right?  [15:33:27]
<consolers> oof  [15:33:32]
<ggole> The default is on. But give it an explicit arg and you don't have to care what the default is.  [15:34:17]
<banisterfiend> i have no idea what an explicit arg is but i just went into c h -v indent-tabs-mode and set it to 'off' so i shop that should do it
                                                                                                                                                [15:35:16]
<banisterfiend> hope*  [15:35:18]
<wolfbone_> 'off'? 'off' as in non-nil as in 'on'? ;-)  [15:37:27]
<banisterfiend> off as in nil i guess  [15:38:44]
<wolfbone_> :)  [15:38:54]
<banisterfiend> im putting this in my .emacs (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil);  [15:38:59]
<banisterfiend> how do i show the value of a variable in emacs? say i wanted to output the value of indent-tabs-mode how would i do that?  [15:39:23]
<ManateeLazyCat> banisterfiend: C-h v  [15:40:11]
<banisterfiend> i did M-: <RET> indent-tabs-mode  [15:40:12]
<ggole> C-h v indent-tabs-mode, or M-: like that  [15:40:24]
<banisterfiend> thx  [15:41:40]
<banisterfiend> when you guys are opening a file with c-x-c-f   and you want to clear the path to type in a new one, what do you type to clear it?
                                                                                                                                                [15:47:13]
<banisterfiend> im doing c-S-backspace which seems a bit clumsy  [15:47:23]
<pgas> banisterfiend: //  [15:47:31]
<banisterfiend> what is that?  [15:48:02]
<pgas> (or maybe / TAB if you don't use ido-mode)  [15:48:05]
<ggole> I use ido, obviating that. But I wrote something to clear minibuffer contents, bound to C-backspace.  [15:48:18]
<pgas> banisterfiend: if you use a // emacs starts to complete from the root  [15:48:36]
<banisterfiend> oh ok thanks  [15:49:03]
<banisterfiend> ok just one last question before i get on with some work (sorry)s in my ruby-mode.el file i've set ruby-indent-level to 4, yet when i go
                M-: ruby-indent-level it ouputs 2 ..why the discrepancy? and how do i make it so it really is 4?  [15:53:53]
<knobo> how do I quit edebug?  [15:56:22]
<knobo> It keeps tracing my functions  [15:56:30]
<ggole> C-]  [15:57:14]
<ggole> Oh, if you want to uninstrument code then that won't do  [15:58:54]
<ggole> That will just break out of the debugger  [15:59:00]
<ggole> Um, one second  [15:59:05]
<lisppaste> ManateeLazyCat pasted "Smart ERC dwim functions" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/71565  [16:00:18]
<ggole> Looks like you load the code again  [16:00:39]
<ManateeLazyCat> Guys, i write some functions for ERC, try it. Those functions are very useful  [16:01:14]
<knobo> No, it looks like I have to reboot my emacs.  [16:04:54]
<knobo> :(  [16:05:07]
<ManateeLazyCat> My function can do different command with `read-only' with ERC, example, i binding "SPACE" with erc-dwim-scroll-up, when cursor at
                 `text-ready-only' area, it do "scroll-up", when input area, it do insert.  [16:05:13]
<knobo> now I knowi I have to start a new emacs for debugging.  [16:05:27]
<banisterfiend> how do i skip to the last character on a line in emacs? (the opposite of M-m)  [16:05:48]
<ggole> knobo: you should be able to call load on whatever libraries you instrumented  [16:06:01]
<ggole> C-e  [16:06:07]
<ggole> That's the last character, not the last printing character  [16:06:26]
<banisterfiend> i want last printing character sorry  [16:06:34]
<knobo> ggole: that's a good idea. I'll try.  [16:06:37]
<ggole> There's no function for that by default afaik  [16:06:45]
<ggole> But if you have trailing whitespace, kill it.  [16:06:52]
<knobo> that fixed it :) thanx ggole.  [16:08:01]

<e-Jah> hi guys  [16:14:54]
<e-Jah> how can I save a file in a determined format? I want to save a file in LATIN1 format   [16:15:14]
<pgas> C-x RET f latin-1 RET  [16:16:41]
<e-Jah> great :)  [16:17:12]
<e-Jah> thank you pgas 
<banisterfiend> i have version 22.1.1 of emacs, should i upgrade it?  [16:17:50]
<ManateeLazyCat> banisterfiend: If you want stable work, choose 22, if you want try newest package or better multi-byte support, choose 23.  [16:20:22]
<banisterfiend> ok thanks  [16:20:38]
<banisterfiend> :)  [16:20:41]
<ManateeLazyCat> I use newest cvs version, ;)  [16:20:55]
<leo___> when using C-x v = to get a vc diff, the *vc-diff* buffer is not readonly, (meaning I can't do RET to go to the source); any clues?  [16:25:44]
<sentor> hi  [16:26:20]
<ManateeLazyCat> hi  [16:26:26]
<naiv> When i click on "view emacs manual" i have "Info file emacs does not exist"; do you know if i need to config something or apt something ?
                                                                                                                                                [16:28:01]
<ManateeLazyCat> naiv: When you compile Emacs, you executive "sudo make info" after "sudo make bootstrap" ?  [16:29:42]
<ggole> Some emacs packages lack the info files iirc  [16:30:30]
<sentor> yesterday i got the actual emacs from cvs. now the version is running on my host but my muse stuff (git latest) doesn't publish to [x]html
         anymore. the backtrace is very long and begins with Debugger enteredmLisp error: (error "Invalid face")  [16:30:36]
<sentor>   internal-get-lisp-face-attribute(nil :height nil)
<sentor>   face-attribute(nil :height)
<sentor> any ideas?  [16:30:49]
<naiv> ManateeLazyCat: i don't compile it, i use apt (debian)  [16:31:10]
<sentor> muse-publish to pdf e.g. is working  [16:31:48]
<ggole> naiv: aptitude search emacs might show you an info package  [16:31:49]
<ManateeLazyCat> naiv: I have not use emacs that from Debian source long time, I compile myself.    [16:32:25]
<naiv> you right, as this doc is non-free (!?$) it is in the package : emacs22-common-non-dfsg  [16:39:58]
<banisterfiend> how would i rebind the C-S-backspace (delete entire line) to M-L ?  [16:40:44]
<dim> hi  [16:42:48]

<banisterfiend> would you say M-l is a pretty useless binding or do you use it alot?  [16:52:59]
<banisterfiend> so it's ok if i overwrite it ? or do you recommend i choose a different binding to overwrite ?  [16:53:12]
<ManateeLazyCat> banisterfiend: type "C-h k" and then type C-S-backspace, you will got describe, and default "C-h k" bending command "describe-key"
                                                                                                                                                [16:53:15]
<ManateeLazyCat> banisterfiend: "M-l" is beind command "downcase-word", sometimes (format text) will use this keystroke alot.  [16:55:12]
<banisterfiend> ok  [16:55:28]
<banisterfiend> well can you think of a simple key combination that isn't used by an important binding that i could use for kill-whole-line? :D
                                                                                                                                                [16:55:49]

<ManateeLazyCat> Super + l  [16:56:14]
<rcy> C-c character is reserved for user bindings  [16:56:30]
<banisterfiend> what is super l ?  [16:57:11]
<ggole> M-L is ok  [16:57:15]
<ManateeLazyCat> In fact, you can use Super keystroke with keystroke do yourself command or function.  [16:57:18]
<ggole> Meta Shift L  [16:57:27]
<ManateeLazyCat> banisterfiend: super is "Start" key  [16:57:49]
<banisterfiend> nice  [16:58:00]
<banisterfiend> ok ManateeLazyCat so how would i rewrite that binding code to use Super instead?  [16:58:17]

<ManateeLazyCat> banisterfiend: Super is code "s", and Shift use "S", so you have to use "s-l"  [16:58:58]
<banisterfiend> ok cool  [16:59:11]
<ManateeLazyCat> banisterfiend: In fact, not anyone command that beding in Emacs default, so you can use Super key beding many command and have not
                 conflict with anyone key that default beding in Emacs.  [17:00:15]
<dim> C-c C-k would sound good too, as C-k is killing till end of current line  [17:00:27]
<banisterfiend> that's great  [17:00:53]
<banisterfiend> thanks  [17:00:55]
<rcy> C-c k would be better  [17:01:38]
<rcy> to guarentee you arent clobbering any major mode bindings  [17:01:54]
<dim> and it's free !  [17:01:56]
<rcy> C-c C-k runs the command rcirc-cmd-kick :)  [17:02:15]
<dim> major mode bindings are meant to use C-c C-whatever ?  [17:02:16]
<ManateeLazyCat> I think the best way to binding is decide by frequency of command use, I bind handy keystroke with command that use always.  [17:02:24]
<dim> banisterfiend seems to be wanting to use 'kill-whole-line quite often, so C-c k sounds like it  [17:03:15]
<dim> well  [17:03:17]
<dim> could be  [17:03:20]
<ManateeLazyCat> And like C-c C-*, i just bind it with command that not use always  [17:03:32]
<rcy> http://xahlee.org/emacs/command-frequency.html  [17:04:25]
<ManateeLazyCat> dim: C-c k is not good, if you always use `kill-whole-line', you will found press C-c k is so slow, i think keystroke that just need
                 press nice is better, example s-k or s-l  [17:04:35]
<ManateeLazyCat> once  [17:04:57]
<ManateeLazyCat> type wrong  [17:05:02]
<twb> How can I disable the "fast user switching" functionality in Ubuntu?  [17:05:07]
<twb> It's not enough to simply remove the panel applet from GNOME, because prisoners can re-add the applet to their panel.  [17:05:27]
<^self> hmm.  don't install gnome?  heh.  [17:05:48]
* ^self has used windowmaker for over a decade  [17:06:02]
<dim> ManateeLazyCat: you get the point  [17:06:10]
<twb> Windowmaker is a window manager, not a desktop environment.  [17:06:14]
<dim> use kde + kiosk to control with precision what your luser are authorized to do?  [17:06:48]
<dim> I don't know of a kiosk tool for gnome  [17:07:02]
<twb> dim: I've already done that with gnome.xml.mandatory, for most other settings.  [17:07:12]
<^self> yeah, i don't use "desktop environments".  [17:07:21]
<^self> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-system-tools/+bug/185599  [17:07:23]
<twb> ^self: I'm looking at that, too.  [17:07:41]
<twb> ^self: but that bug was written, I suspect, by a GUI-using idiot.  [17:07:55]
<twb> Ideally I want to disable this by editing /etc, probably gconf.xml.mandatory/ or gdm.conf.  [17:08:21]
<dim> http://extragear.kde.org/apps/kiosktool/ o anything equivalent for gnome should help manage the problem twb  [17:08:28]
<twb> dim: that's a GUI.  [17:08:41]
<dim> yes, for controling files  [17:08:50]
<twb> dim: the equivalent GUIs for GNOME are for idiots who USE gnome.  [17:08:52]
<dim> ahah.  [17:08:58]
<twb> I just administer a GNOME system, I don't use it.  [17:09:01]
<dim> well, the gui exposes feautures, they still exist without the gui  [17:09:13]
<dim> so go figure the inner details if you're inclined to do so  [17:09:25]
<twb> dim: yes, but then I'd still have to strace the tool to find out how it works, as I did for the GNOME kiosk tools  [17:09:34]
<dim> I don't think so.  [17:09:43]
<dim> http://techbase.kde.org/SysAdmin  [17:09:51]
<twb> Since this is rather late in the project, I'm not inclined to adopt KDE.  [17:09:55]
<dim> http://techbase.kde.org/KDE_System_Administration/Kiosk/Introduction  [17:10:05]
<dim> I think this later document explains how to do it without the GUI  [17:10:23]
<dim> now, you're after the same think for GNOME, good luck.  [17:10:35]
<twb> dim: it's called gconf.xml.mandatory.  [17:11:46]
<twb> dim: but I can't find the appropriate setting to lock down in the GNOME registry.
<dim> [KDE Action Restrictions][$i] action/logout=false
<dim> that's it, it seems  [17:11:49]
<twb> 20:11 <twb> Since this is rather late in the project, I'm not inclined to adopt KDE.  [17:11:56]
<dim> or maybe not  [17:12:02]
<dim> I wish you good luck, I don't think I'm able to help that much in fact :)  [17:12:19]
<twb> OK, thanks anyway  [17:12:26]
<e-Jah> how can i print my buffer many times ? I thought C-x n M-x print-buffer  [17:16:56]
<e-Jah> would work  [17:16:58]
<e-Jah> but no :(  [17:17:01]
<e-Jah> (replace n by the number of copies I want)  [17:17:14]
<twb> Found it  [17:17:47]
<twb>  /desktop/gnome/lockdown/disable_user_switching  [17:17:49]
<twb> Argh, it's ALREADY DISABLED by my code.  I guess my boss just created the task again to annoy mes  [17:18:56]

<ManateeLazyCat> Guys, use lisppaste and my function "lisppaste-irc-paste" can paste big context in IRC channel fast on fly.  [10:03:52]
<ManateeLazyCat> Enjoy,  [10:03:55]
<a-s> me thinks that lisppaste-irc-paste is an understable code, that do not require comments  [10:03:59]
<a-s> ManateeLazyCat: your function is good to get banned.  [10:05:13]
<ManateeLazyCat> Thanks  [10:05:22]
<a-s> great!  [10:05:38]
<ManateeLazyCat> Just enjoy!  [10:06:36]
<a-s> ManateeLazyCat: you should have used recursivity without a terminal condition, in order to be sure that you get banned before stopping it
                                                                                                                                                [10:07:05]
<a-s> ManateeLazyCat: how long have you been using emacs?  [10:07:47]
<ManateeLazyCat> The purpose that i write this function is i hate use w3m open special webpaste and write many form content, this function make me paste
                 IRC big content on the fly  [10:07:55]
<ManateeLazyCat> 1 year  [10:08:00]
<a-s> ManateeLazyCat: can you explain me how to print 'x' instead of spaces or blanks on the screen?  [10:09:07]
<a-s> at the level of C code.  [10:09:13]

*** hoang (n=hoang@210.245.58.38) is now known as hoangdt  [10:11:57]
<hoangdt> hi all,  [10:12:07]
<hoangdt> how can I search in all buffers ?  [10:12:15]
<a-s> hoangdt: hi  [10:12:17]
<consolers> what is the purpose behind it  [10:12:31]
<consolers> anyway  [10:12:43]
<ggole> hoangdt: multi-occur  [10:12:47]
<ggole> But multi-occur sucks  [10:12:53]
<ManateeLazyCat> hoangdt: Yeah multi-occur is very nice for search buffers  [10:13:06]
<ggole> grep is usually better, since most buffers tend to be backed by files  [10:13:10]
<hoangdt> oh thanks Mana and ggole  [10:13:50]
<hoangdt> I think that's sometimes useful  [10:14:06]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: Because i'm too lazy people, like my nick. And lisppaste is very nice, but i want just press "C-c C-y" in ERC do paste big
                 content and don't write channel-name and nick-name  [10:14:17]
<ggole> It is, but it's a pain to specify all the buffers to search  [10:14:18]
<a-s> hoangdt: you can also write a little function using with-current-buffer, isearchs  etc.  [10:14:32]
<ggole> ManateeLazyCat: then use lisppaste.el  [10:14:34]
<ManateeLazyCat> ggole: Refactory?  [10:14:36]
<ggole> Refactory? To factory again?  [10:14:58]
<ggole> Oh, that commercial elisp thingy  [10:15:05]
<ggole> I don't use that  [10:15:09]
<hoangdt> a-s: yes, however if there's a function to do that, that's fine  [10:15:28]
<ManateeLazyCat> ggole: I always use multi-occur refactory my elisp project.  [10:15:29]
<ggole> ManateeLazyCat: so it has a search-in-project feature?  [10:15:47]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: So only case is that i'm too lazy, if can use keyshot, i don't will type command in minibuffer.  [10:16:21]
*** mr_lunchy (n=dml@ppp121-44-87-127.lns10.syd6.internode.on.net) is now known as davelee  [10:16:28]
<consolers> mana i dont get it still but nevermind  [10:16:55]
<ManateeLazyCat> a-s: Multi-occur is very nice, you can try it, it's not just with-current-buffer, it even can search regexp in special buffers.
                                                                                                                                                [10:17:09]
<a-s> i used just occur  [10:17:46]
<ManateeLazyCat> ggole: I think multi-occur give a better interface for search and replace string in many buffers.  [10:18:17]
<ggole> It doesn't do that out of the box, though  [10:18:53]
<ManateeLazyCat> a-s: You can try it, multi-occur is very handy than occur, sometimes.  [10:18:54]
<a-s> I figure so.  [10:19:25]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: so how to do you paste something in IRC?
<a-s> ManateeLazyCat: you can send commands to the bot using your function  [10:20:03]
<ManateeLazyCat> So guys, i try to use my lisppaste-irc-paste again, and paste some nice code.  [10:20:37]
<lisppaste> ManateeLazyCat pasted "My erc code for move fly like vim" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/71612  [10:21:44]
<consolers> i wonder how many posts/minute lisppaste can take  [10:22:42]
<consolers> heh  [10:22:55]
<ManateeLazyCat> Guys, try to binding some keystroke with erc-mode-map, example, bind 'j' with "erc-dwim-scroll-up", you can scroll-up buffer when you
                 type 'j' at 'read-only' area of ERC, and otherwise you can insert 'j' in type area.  [10:23:33]
<ManateeLazyCat> and others functions is same work  [10:23:54]
<ManateeLazyCat> I think it's a good idea, move like vim in `read-only' area of buffer, and other insert command.  [10:26:02]
<ManateeLazyCat> ggole: You know this have a free extension that refactory code in Emacs?  [10:26:34]
<ggole> I'd heard that, yes  [10:29:45]

<ManateeLazyCat> hoangdt: If you like "anything-mode", you can try to use contentswitch   [10:30:49]
<ManateeLazyCat> ggole: So what name that extension? I just use multi-occur do simple refactory work.  [10:32:16]
<ggole> What? Weren't you talking about refactory, the commerical elisp package?  [10:34:23]
<ggole> Or Xrefactory, whatever it's called  [10:34:32]
<twb> ,xrefactory  [10:34:37]
<fsbot> From memory, xrefactory is proprietary software for Emacs, XEmacs and jEdit providing various IDE features <http://emacswiki.org/wiki/XreFactory>
<ManateeLazyCat> ggole: Not Xrefactory, that can't refactory elisp code, I say refactory extension for elisp  [10:35:08]
<hoangdt> ManateeLazyCat: thanks u, i will try  [10:35:28]
<twb> Nobody should be writing elisp  [10:35:29]
<ManateeLazyCat> twb: Strange, why?  [10:36:13]
<twb> Because elisp is crap  [10:36:44]
<twb> Use a proper language  [10:36:46]
<ManateeLazyCat> twb: At least, Emacs use elisp  [10:37:23]
<consolers> elisp is great  [10:37:37]

<ManateeLazyCat> twb: I don't plain to use elisp write high-perfermence software, i think Haskell is very nice for that. But Emacs use elisp is very
                 beautiful...  [10:39:02]
<twb> elisp isn't beautiful!  [10:39:30]
<consolers> dont kid yourself youre writing throwaway toys anyway  [10:39:35]
<consolers> even in those languages  [10:39:47]
<consolers> dont kid yourself. you're writing throwaway toys.   [10:40:07]
<consolers> use elisp. dont drink the formal methods static typing must kool aid!  [10:40:53]
<ManateeLazyCat> twb: At least, elisp is best choose for Emacs, except someone use other language rewrite Emacs, like Yi -- a Emacs like editor that
                 write in Haskell  [10:41:19]
<ggole> I'm sort of appalled by elisp, but I still like it. It's like an ugly beaten up street cat wandered in, curled up on my lap, and started purring.
                                                                                                                                                [10:41:20]

<ggole> ManateeLazyCat: no, I thought you were talking about it  [10:42:33]
<twb> Yi isn't emacs-like.  [10:42:56]
<twb> Yi is more like Vi than Emacs, except that Yi is reasonably programmable without resorting to perl  [10:43:19]
<ManateeLazyCat> twb: But have many feature of Yi like Emacs.  [10:44:23]
<twb> ManateeLazyCat: what?  [10:45:38]
<ManateeLazyCat> I think do a haskell interpeter like Emacs is better, and do all thing base one Haskell.  [10:45:51]
<ManateeLazyCat> And not just copy Emacs, I think this's not good idea that Yi develop.  [10:46:33]

                 Dired.hs Eval.hs Keymap.hs etc.  [10:47:38]
<twb> I've seen the Yi code.  [10:48:07]
<consolers> manatee it'll still suck. its in haskell  [10:48:17]
<twb> I still think it's more like Vi than Emacs, or at least was when last I looked at it.  [10:48:37]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: So, what is not suck?  [10:48:39]
<twb> I avoid Yi because it's tty mode is crap m everyone seems to use its GTK mode  [10:49:07]

<consolers> "why this software will waste your time"  [10:49:30]
<ManateeLazyCat> twb: Yep, i agree. In keystroke handle, it's like Vi, and many core mode, it's like Emacs more.  [10:49:50]
<a-s> ManateeLazyCat: do you use Yi?  [10:49:51]
<twb> I guesss  [10:50:02]
<ManateeLazyCat> a-s: I use it, but i don't the develop direction of Yi develop, it's like copy Vi and Emacs.  [10:50:33]

                 it's hard to debug. And elisp can't do those thing fast and multi-thread.  [11:00:53]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: w3m just for text read, is very nice.  [11:01:16]
<consolers> mana, nothing except corporate pressures stopped someone from writing a webbrowser which was scriptable by lisp  [11:01:36]
<consolers> you are forced to use mozilla or webkit because of investment directions and social engineering in the webspace  [11:02:17]
<consolers> and its no accident they are not easy to modify  [11:02:31]
<consolers> or that you can do what you want   [11:02:54]
<aartist> I cannot figure out how to configure anything  [11:03:01]
<consolers> or you can control them
<aartist> that is anything.el  [11:03:14]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: If elisp can do multi-thread, just if. I want write a new render engine for web is best way, that will integrate with Emacs.

<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: And not use webkit or other.  [11:03:45]
<consolers> multithread is not the problem i think  [11:03:52]
<taruti> Why reinvent the wheel?  [11:04:01]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: Write new one is easy than modified mozilla  or webkit  [11:04:05]
<ggole> That's questionable  [11:04:17]
<consolers> mana i dont think theres any use  [11:04:21]
<ManateeLazyCat> aartist: EmacsWiki have detail.  [11:04:37]
<ManateeLazyCat> , anything  [11:04:45]
<consolers> ggole you spawn a process like netcat to do the network io
<consolers> works great
<fsbot> ManateeLazyCat, I heard anything is [0] http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/anything.el  [11:04:46]

<ggole> What's that got to do with the problem of "correctly" rendering html?  [11:05:08]
<consolers> where "correctly" is defined by investments  [11:05:31]
<consolers> as a moving target  [11:05:38]
<consolers> spam industry investments.  [11:06:07]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: Think this case, if implement browser like firefox in Emacs, i can write blog or HTML source code in buffer, and just press
                 some key, Emacs can use HTML render engine in this buffer. And then Emacs is not just editor, he  will became a awestruck Information
                 tools  [11:07:04]
<consolers> mana, i've thought about it in 1997!  [11:07:22]
<consolers> no doubt others have too  [11:08:08]
<consolers> in 97 w3 was very promising  [11:08:39]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: And not this, if this not browser, just do a render engine to render complex content (not just text) in Emacs, so i can
                 integrate many tools in Emacs, have handy keyboard handle, human interface.  [11:08:57]
<ManateeLazyCat> So Emacs become a interface between user and OS.  [11:09:51]
<consolers> manatee thats where the idea breaks down  [11:10:07]
<ManateeLazyCat> And then Emacs not just "everything is buffer"  [11:10:11]
<consolers> the rendering engine = webkit or xulrunner's  [11:10:17]
<consolers> then youre using incompatible components from projects with different a ageda  [11:10:39]
<consolers> even within emacs there is precedent. you cant use gnus mime with other emacs email clients  because the projects have different agenda
                                                                                                                                                [11:11:17]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: Not that mean, rendering engine just render everything in Emacs, not matter web. And then Browser just a mode of Emacs.
                                                                                                                                                [11:11:20]
<consolers> each wants you to use them exclusively  [11:11:26]
<ManateeLazyCat> So then we can browser web not like firefox, we can do everything like Emacs style.  [11:12:18]
<consolers> no mana, the rendering is complex enough (thanks to w3c and standards bodies that companies each spend 10 million USD a year to fund)
                                                                                                                                                [11:12:20]
<consolers> so its not easy  [11:12:26]
<consolers> you cant compete with the cartel  [11:12:41]
<consolers> and they dont want you to have the extensibility which would be harmful to them  [11:13:29]
<consolers> instead they will provide the illusion via endorsed opensource tools like firefox which have a big enough userbase to maintain the status quo
                                                                                                                                                [11:14:28]
<consolers> mozilla 1.6 gave me more control over my browser than xulrunner 1.9  [11:15:00]
<consolers> i see control being systematically removed  [11:15:13]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: I think a question about this, if do this must modified the core of Emacs, and now C and elisp is mix in Emacs, and many
                 extension in Emacs, so it's very difficult to this, and another way is use a language (not mix language) rewrite core of Emacs, and
                 re-design Emacs for browser (or others, like reader).   [11:15:15]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: No, mozilla is great, but it's purpose is for browser, I'm thinking a INTERFACE between USER and OS (and many other
                 tools). It can integrate Firefox and Emacs, and do more and more  [11:16:51]
<consolers> hmm  [11:17:17]
<consolers> have you been reading too much yegge? :)  [11:17:33]
<consolers> (not that i ever read him but from conversation i read in #emacs i assume he talks of same things)  [11:18:00]
<consolers> mana, the problem is then: you might as well drop elisp and emacs, and build your perfect system, then you face the same forces that stop you
            from building your perfect system on top of emacs  [11:18:57]
<consolers> well not exactly same  [11:19:16]
<isomer> too much discussion and not enough coding :)  [11:19:32]
<consolers> anyways  [11:19:33]
<consolers> i'm off  [11:19:34]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: Think this, Emacs is best for use keyboard handle everything, but because elisp can render complex graphics in Emacs, so it's
                 have a bad interface for Emacs, example Browser and others thing.  [11:20:27]
<ManateeLazyCat> So if re-design Emacs for do more this thing, We can develop many command-line program do low-level works, and use Emacs render friendly
                 interface for User, so It's a powerful tool to get information of this world (do like Google)     [11:22:18]
<ManateeLazyCat> And then not limit Browser and Editor, just one: Emacs and do everything, Browser, Reader, Editor, Download Manager, Scaner. etc.
                                                                                                                                                [11:23:12]
<ManateeLazyCat> Just coding and integrate everything with your imagine.  [11:23:44]
<ManateeLazyCat> Because Emacs's purpose is do best editor and have so many extension for Emacs, and in fact, many extension for Emacs just text and can
                 work, and not friendly and perfect.  [11:25:44]
<isomer> personally, i prefer vi for this type of integration  [11:26:01]
<ManateeLazyCat> consolers: I think if i develop this system, i don't will choose elisp, maybe Haskell  [11:26:39]
<hengha> how can I feed the compilation buffer to bury-buffer with run-with-timer I put something like this : (run-with-timer 4 nil 'bury-buffer
         "*compilation*"), it seemed not working  [11:26:50]
<ManateeLazyCat> isomer: Think this, If you choose Vi, you need Xchat for IRC, and you need many other tools do different thing for many work, so need
                 pay for many memory and time for integration, and in Emacs, you just need one: Emacs  [11:28:10]
<isomer> yeah, but the whole modeless editing thing. so many keystrokes to remember  [11:28:42]
<consolers> manatee  [11:30:44]
<consolers> kaesfh  [11:30:46]
<ManateeLazyCat> isomer: But that is good for remember, you will become effective more and more, example, when you configuration right ERC, you can IRC
                 talk in Emacs always same, but in Vi, if you want IRC, you have to use XChat (or others), and then you just can control Vi, but you need
                 change with many other application and them not control by you.  [11:30:52]
<consolers> remember Symbolics is now owned by IRS  [11:31:06]
<ManateeLazyCat> isomer: In Emacs, you can control everything, Vi you just control edit.  [11:31:42]
<isomer> but you have to program in elisp!  [11:31:55]
<ManateeLazyCat> isomer: If you write elisp, you will found it's powerful than script. In Vi, if you want change is more difficult, but in Emacs, it's
                 just some minus.  [11:33:20]
<ManateeLazyCat> And last, i just give my point, choose you like ;)  [11:33:40]
<isomer> so are you going to write this thing?  [11:34:17]
<hengha> how can I feed the compilation buffer to bury-buffer with run-with-timer I put something like this : (run-with-timer 4 nil 'bury-buffer
         "*compilation*"), it seemed not working  [11:34:59]
<ManateeLazyCat> hengha: You perhaps like use tempbuf-mode to manager temp buffer  [11:36:17]
<ManateeLazyCat> , tempbuf  [11:36:21]
<hengha> ManateeLazyCat: thanks, I am almost there, just this little step  [11:37:45]
<ManateeLazyCat> hengha: NP ;)  [11:38:01]
<hengha> :-p  [11:38:10]

<a-s`> I give up.  [21:46:05]
<a-s`> I do not succed to change the colors in dired  [21:46:20]
<a-s`> succeed  [21:46:32]
<ggole> Try making a working regexp first with re-builder  [21:47:09]
<ggole> "\\w\\.c$" would be a good start  [21:48:07]
<a-s`> ggole: it worked. thanks. your regexp was good  [21:51:37]
<a-s`> however, I want to show it in blue, not using a predefined face  [21:52:13]
<a-s`> http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/def-face-const.el  [21:53:27]
<lisppaste> ManateeLazyCat pasted "Just test hpaste code" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/71637  [21:53:49]
<ManateeLazyCat> Guys, ignoe it, i just test hpaste code  [21:54:11]
* fledermaus goes and looks  [21:55:49]
<ggole> The .el files I have for this emacs are stashed in a .gz. If I prepare a patch against them (using diff-buffer-with-file), will that be
        problematic or annoying for the maintainer who looks at the patch? Presumably their filenames are different.  [21:55:51]
<REENA> I tried Yannisnippet and it doesn't work with TAB, what's wrong? I can see YASnippet in menu bar  [21:59:41]
<fledermaus> ,repro  [21:59:54]
<fsbot> tell us EXACTLY 1) what you typed; 2) what you saw; and 3) what you expected to see.  [21:59:55]
<KragenSitaker> REENA: is there a " yas " in your modeline? and what mode are you trying to use it in, and what are you typing to try to get a snippet
                inserted?  [22:01:05]
<ManateeLazyCat> ManateeLazyCat pasted "My test version of hpaste.el" at http://hpaste.org/12731  [22:06:11]
<ManateeLazyCat> Looks like work, continue test  [22:06:34]
<REENA> KragenSitaker: Yes it does  [22:10:53]
<REENA> KragenSitaker: I use CSS Mode  [22:11:15]
<toddoon> do you if there exist a debian repository of .deb for emacs packages?  [22:17:34]
<toddoon> *know  [22:18:17]
<Sketch> there are emacs packages in the official debian repositories  [22:19:13]
<ggole> Query them, ie aptitude search emacs  [22:19:38]
<Sketch> there is also an unofficial repository with cvs builds  [22:20:17]
<toddoon> i have already get all of these  [22:24:05]
* consolers just builds from cvs  [22:29:25]
<TheGeralt> hi, where can I find a documentation/howto for emac's todo-mode?  [22:29:30]
<a-s`> ggole: to define a new color you need a regewxp and a fontface. to define a new fontface one can use
       http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/def-face-const.el  [22:29:35]
<consolers> TheGeralt it was pretty unusable when i tried it decades ago  [22:29:56]
<consolers> ,todo-mode  [22:29:58]
<fsbot> I think TodoMode is [0] at http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TodoMode  [22:30:00]
<fsbot> [1] at http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ToDomode
<consolers> nowadays people use orgmode  [22:30:12]
<TheGeralt> consolers: thanks, then I'll take a look into orgmode  [22:30:26]
<ggole> a-s`: what's wrong with defface?  [22:30:55]
<TheGeralt> ok, org-mode comes with some integrated documentation (so it wins :-))  [22:31:06]
<consolers> if youre using emacs 22 get a new release  [22:31:26]
<ggole> I agree that the face stuff is pretty unintuitive, but you shouldn't need another .el to use it  [22:31:33]
<consolers> from orgmode.org  [22:31:35]
<consolers> [i dont use orgmode for TODO myself, i have my homegrown text file format  which supports timestamps with timezones]  [22:32:18]
<a-s`> ggole: I do not know anything about faces.  [22:33:34]
<toddoon> ,dv features  [22:45:58]
<fsbot> A list of symbols which are the features of the executing Emacs.
<fsbot> Used by `featurep' and `require', and altered by `provide'.
<toddoon> ,dv load-history  [22:46:21]
<fsbot> Alist mapping file names to symbols and features.  [22:46:22]
<fsbot> Each alist element is a list that starts with a file name,
<fsbot> except for one element (optional) that starts with nil and describes
<fsbot> definitions evaluated from buffers not visiting filese i[Type ,more]
<toddoon> ,more  [22:46:40]
<fsbot> The file name is absolute and is the true file name (i.e. it doesn't  [22:46:41]
<fsbot> contain symbolic links) of the loaded file.
<fsbot> The remaining elements of each list are symbols defined as variables
<fsbot> and cons cells of the form `(provide . FEATURE)', `(require . FEATURE)', i[Type ,more]
<toddoon> ,more  [22:47:05]
<fsbot> `(defun . FUNCTION)', `(autoload . SYMBOL)', `(defface . SYMBOL)'  [22:47:06]
<fsbot> and `(t . SYMBOL)'.  An element `(t . SYMBOL)' precedes an entry
<fsbot> `(defun . FUNCTION)', and means that SYMBOL was an autoload before
<fsbot> this file redefined it as a functione i[Type ,more]
<toddoon> i want to paste the load-history in a file, in shell i would do cat load-history > foo.txt, what about emacs?  [22:49:41]
<ggole> ,dk M-:  [22:50:35]
<fsbot> eval-expression is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `simple.el'.
<fsbot> It is bound to M-:, M-ESC :.  [22:50:36]
<fsbot> (eval-expression EVAL-EXPRESSION-ARG &optional
<fsbot> EVAL-EXPRESSION-INSERT-VALUE)

<ManateeLazyCat> ManateeLazyCat pasted "My modified version of hpaste.el" at http://hpaste.org/12744  [22:50:51]
<ggole> See the second argument, which you set with C-u  [22:50:53]
<ManateeLazyCat> twb: Try use my modified version of hpaste.el  [22:51:14]
<ManateeLazyCat> twb: Just try my new function "hpaste-paste-erc-create"  [22:51:56]
<toddoon> ggole: i have some difficulties to understand  [22:52:39]
<ManateeLazyCat> twb: Now you can paste in any IRC channel and don't need any bot in channel  [22:53:00]
<ggole> toddoon: C-u M-: load-history  [22:53:33]
<Ober> erc da bomb  [22:53:36]
<toddoon> ggole: i'll test it  [22:53:49]
<KragenSitaker> REENA: there are some snippets defined by default for CSS mode; are they there in the YASnippet menu? what happens if you type "bor" and
                hit Tab?  [22:54:14]
<dsevil> ggole: I tried that and I see a lot of s instead of the full value.  [22:54:39]
<ggole> Hmm, it must use print  [22:55:16]
<toddoon> i dont works for me too
<dsevil> ah, eval-expression-print-level  [22:56:53]
<dsevil> and eval-expression-print-length  [22:57:04]
<ggole> M-: (insert (format "%s" load-history))  [22:57:53]
<dsevil> that too  [22:59:00]
<ggole> Quite long on this emacs  [22:59:11]
<ggole> Don't hit C-e :)  [22:59:19]
<dsevil> anyone know offhand  what load-history uses?  it shows the value nicely indented.  [23:00:01]
<dsevil> erm  [23:00:18]
<dsevil> s/load-history/describe-variable/  [23:00:25]
<TheGeralt> to which program belongs /var/log/cache/edb?  [23:00:26]
<ggole> dsevil: pp  [23:00:44]
<ggole> Short for pretty-print  [23:00:48]
<KragenSitaker> TheGeralt: what OS are you on?  [23:00:50]
<dsevil> yay!  [23:01:20]
<toddoon> how do you do when loading big big files with emacs?  [23:02:19]
<twb> ManateeLazyCat: I don't use ERC.  [23:02:26]
<toddoon> for example load-history?  [23:02:27]
<TheGeralt> KragenSitaker: oh, wrong channel, it's gentoo  [23:02:31]
<toddoon> my computer has difficulties to read this files is there a solution?  [23:03:21]
<twb> fsbot: tell toddoon about twb-fix  [23:04:10]
<fsbot> toddoon: I heard twb-fix is most problems can be solved by installing Debian
<ggole> Turn font mode off with C-u -1 M-x global-font-lock-mode  [23:04:40]
<ggole> *font lock  [23:04:45]
<ggole> Or don't print huge values to buffers and then look at them  [23:05:00]
<ggole> Using pp might help as well, since emacs seems to slow right down on long lines  [23:05:47]
<twb> FSVO long lines = the file has no \n at all  [23:06:23]
<ggole> Yeah. And (length (format "%s" load-history)) -> 310008 (#o1135370, #x4baf8)  [23:08:05]
<toddoon> lol  [23:08:22]
<toddoon> i retry  [23:08:25]
<twb> 50k here  [23:08:43]
<ggole> You minimalist.  [23:08:51]
<twb> What can I say?  I autoload.  [23:09:01]
<toddoon> and then  [23:09:52]
<toddoon> so emacs is not made for read file > 50k?  [23:12:07]
<ggole> The problem is very long lines, not long files.  [23:12:49]
<toddoon> ok ggole  [23:13:01]
<toddoon> so dont you have a little function to shrink lines to 80characters for example?  [23:13:26]
<toddoon> i believe that load-history display lines well formatted  [23:13:59]
<ManateeLazyCat> twb: So what is use for IRC?  [23:14:30]
<consolers> toddoon, it used to be ok until emacs 19  [23:15:38]
<consolers> after emacs 20 introduced faces, regexp and font lock can be used as DoS attacks to eat your processor  [23:16:09]
<toddoon> consolers: whats going wrong after?  [23:16:13]
<toddoon> oups  [23:16:28]
<consolers> text properties + face conflation + regexp matching for fontification = killer  [23:16:54]
<consolers> this was mid 90s though  [23:17:20]
<toddoon> ok  [23:17:51]
<consolers> your best bet is to disable font-lock before starting emacs  [23:17:56]
<consolers> its hard to have global-font-lock-mode and then selectively disable it  [23:18:13]
<toddoon> i will test it  [23:18:39]
<consolers> did i understand   [23:19:24]
<consolers> i have no idea if i understood what your problem was  [23:19:34]
<consolers> (i tried to show snogglethorpe a test case but he wouldnt listen)  [23:20:06]
<toddoon> i was trying to read a unique line of 99999s characters  [23:20:13]
<consolers> which mode?  [23:20:20]
<toddoon> no mode, in text-mode  [23:20:32]
<consolers> hmm i doubt that'd cause a problem  [23:20:55]
<toddoon> the problem was when scrolling  [23:21:09]
<consolers> ah  [23:21:12]
<consolers> yeah  [23:21:21]
<consolers> ever since the new display engine in emacs 20.  [23:21:42]
<consolers> hexl-mode  [23:22:30]
<ManateeLazyCat> ManateeLazyCat pasted "Paste in IRC channel on the fly" at http://hpaste.org/12746  [23:22:46]
<ManateeLazyCat> Guys, try to use this extension, and use command "hpaste-paste-erc-create" can paste in IRC channel on the fly  [23:23:55]
<ManateeLazyCat> This extension not like lisppaste.el need `lisppaste' bot in channel, it's paste in hpaste.org and display link in channel after paste.
                                                                                                                                                [23:25:20]

<dsevil> Okay, so dired has dired-do-query-replace-regexp, bound to Q.  Does the Buffer List have an equivalent?
* johnsu01 has one  [23:38:12]
<dsevil> moleskins are neato  [23:38:22]

<johnsu01> so, how man people would buy a moleskine from the FSF that had emacs reference in the back? :)  [23:38:44]
<toddoon> i load (functions variables path) +6000 different statements, thats my load-history results, this why finally emacs debian packages are not so

<dsevil> consolers: it's not so much the quality.  it's the fact that packages in debian are old.  [23:41:22]
<Sketch> consolers: you could do that just as well on debian ;)  [23:41:27]
<ManateeLazyCat> CVS version is very nice, i like ;)  [23:41:43]
<z0d> dsevil: I used to use sid  [23:41:51]
<Sketch> i'm mostly curious because i'm switching from fedora to debian  [23:42:15]
<consolers> I quit when sarge was testing  [23:42:22]
<toddoon> ManateeLazyCat: they said the cvs was updated each weeks i haven't had one update since i'm using CVS  [23:42:30]
<dsevil> i'd try ubuntu minimal install or something
<jogla> Sketch: I did that a few weeks ago  [23:42:33]
<dsevil> one of these days i'll dick around with ubuntu myself  [23:42:38]
<dsevil> but i don't want gnome or kde bloat  [23:42:47]
<consolers> too bad  [23:43:07]
<ManateeLazyCat> toddoon: Why, sometimes i update cvs version everyday. ;-)  [23:43:15]
<Sketch> the debian installer may not be pretty, but at least I could make it do what i wanted  [23:43:24]
<jogla> i think it is pretty pretty  [23:43:38]
<toddoon> ManateeLazyCat: i speak about the debian package called emacs-snapshot (your weekly doses)  [23:44:02]
<ManateeLazyCat> toddoon: I make Emacs install HOME, and control all source code. It's very nice.  [23:44:03]
<dsevil> its simplicity is its beauty  [23:44:17]
<ManateeLazyCat> toddoon: I don't get Emacs from Debian package   [23:44:23]
<z0d> dsevil: Try stumpwm or xmonad  [23:44:27]
<wfarr> ManateeLazyCat: I use /usr/local, but yeah, same idea. =)  [23:44:31]
* dsevil uses ion3  [23:44:33]
<consolers> mana no need to install just run it where it compiled
<toddoon> ManateeLazyCat: i understood after  [23:44:37]
<Sketch> actually i didn't try the graphical one, that one could be pretty ;)  [23:45:14]
<wfarr> consolers: The idea behind installing is that you can have a sensible item in PATH that'll give you all the other things that get compiled *with*
        Emacs.  [23:45:21]
<ManateeLazyCat> toddoon: I think compile self is best way, don't wait Debian update it.   [23:45:28]
<consolers> ah theres only lib-src   [23:45:42]
<wfarr> (I use ctags/etags personally)  [23:45:45]
<Sketch> (i don't usually use the graphical fedora installer eithersin fact, it couldn't get a functional gui screen on the box i just built)  [23:45:55]
<e1f> i think the laser etched logo on the cover will sell better than the emacs refcard in the back  [23:46:01]
<dsevil> short shameful confession: i'm one of those people who would rather put up with emacs22 for a while longer than dick around with compiling.
                                                                                                                                                [23:46:17]
<toddoon> ManateeLazyCat: but in using repository you compile it each day?  [23:46:23]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: In fact, I have a directory ~/MyEmacs to maintain source code of Emacs, core and extension (collected or self write)  [23:46:30]
<consolers> the problem with make install is the .el code  [23:46:44]
<ManateeLazyCat> toddoon: Sometime, for test bug of Emacs, i will compile it everyday.  [23:47:05]
<wfarr> consolers: How so?  [23:47:09]
<ManateeLazyCat> toddoon: Normal i update when i found cool feature or bug fix.  [23:47:24]
<toddoon> ManateeLazyCat: how any times does it takes to compile?  [23:47:39]
<e1f> johnsu01: : it seems mit has a laser etching machine http://www.flickr.com/photos/hoakyman/sets/72157604134828878/  [23:47:40]
<consolers> i just call echo 'PATH=$PATH:/path/to/emacs/lib-src /path/to/emacs/src/emacs "$@"' > /usr/local/bin/emacs  [23:47:42]
<toddoon> *many  [23:47:44]
<consolers> wfarr it copies it  [23:47:53]
<johnsu01> e1f: I think MIT also has a nuclear weapon  [23:47:57]
<wfarr> ManateeLazyCat: Huh, interesting stuff. I have a script I run roughly every 2-3 days which compiles Emacs.app for OS X if there are updates to
        pull down (ie. almost every time), and I keep all my own developmental elisp in the same git repository as my config.  [23:48:04]
<wfarr> consolers: Eh, I'm not worried about the space, tbh.  [23:48:11]
<consolers> i also set TERM   [23:48:13]
<ManateeLazyCat> toddoon: My machine, 10 minutes  [23:48:14]
<e1f> johnsu01: only one?  [23:48:22]
<wfarr> toddoon: on my 2.4GHz, C2D, compiling with -j2, I can compile Emacs fully in 3-5 minutes, usually.  [23:48:42]
<consolers> make install buys you nothing really  [23:48:43]
<consolers> except more complexity which can be avoided  [23:48:54]
<wfarr> consolers: In my case it does, since I roll the .app  [23:48:57]
<consolers> (i'm only talking of CVS emacs)  [23:49:27]
<toddoon> wfarr: ok great i think i will forget packages precompiled and not updateds  [23:49:33]
<wfarr> consolers: I roll .app from the git mirror of CVS ;)  [23:49:39]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: Perhaps i can fast than you, because i'm always compile emacs and run VirtualBox and watch movies   [23:49:59]
<wfarr> heh  [23:50:08]
<wfarr> I usually only do email or web browsing while compiling, so yeah.  [23:50:23]
<toddoon> isnt it svn protocols to get emacs?  [23:50:25]
<consolers> thank god no  [23:50:42]
<wfarr> toddoon: There are various mirros for other VCS systems.  [23:50:44]
<KragenSitaker> e1f: a lot of places have laser etching machines.  They only cost a few thousand dollars.  the wood shop down the street from my house
                has one.  [23:50:45]
<wfarr> There are git and bzr mirrors, in addition to the actual CVS repo.  [23:50:55]
<consolers> i'd have switched to pike's editor rather than use svn to get at emacs code  [23:51:02]
<dsevil> why the hate on svn?  [23:51:14]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: In fact, if i don't leave Emacs, I compile at another machine and play Emacs in current machine. :)  [23:51:17]
<toddoon> i used svn in my job and i dont know about other version control protocol  [23:51:35]
<wfarr> ManateeLazyCat: heh.  [23:51:46]
<wfarr> dsevil: It's hip and cool to hate on anything.  [23:52:00]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: Can't you use EMMS?  [23:52:19]
<consolers> dsevil  hard to articulate the repulsion   [23:52:20]
<wfarr> toddoon: I prefer the git mirror, but the CVS repo is just as easy to use given that you probably won't compile Emacs as often as I do.
                                                                                                                                                [23:52:43]
<wfarr> ManateeLazyCat: Hmm? EMMS?  [23:52:48]
<consolers> (not hard, with profanity)  [23:52:51]
<toddoon> wfarr: i'm already installing cvs  [23:53:22]
<wfarr> toddoon: Fun stuff. =)  [23:53:28]
<toddoon> wfarr: thx  [23:53:40]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: I have two purpose for compile Emacs: cool feature or fix bug  [23:53:43]
<wfarr> ManateeLazyCat: I usually compile it to rake in bug fixes, and for bragging rights.  [23:54:04]
<consolers> ftr i stopped updating mplayer after they switched to svn  [23:54:05]
<wfarr> Mostly bug fixes though.  [23:54:24]
<dsevil> consolers: cvs is much more icky in my opinion than svn  [23:54:32]
<consolers> svn keeps copies of all files but no metadata. why?  [23:54:57]
<wfarr> For example, right now I'm watching commits to see if connection to an emacs mdaemon via emacsclient with a new frame in the windowing
        environment gets fixed.
<consolers> why do i have to go to network to do history?  [23:55:11]
<consolers> i already have all the files  [23:55:23]
<wfarr> ^ This is why I like dvcs in general, but especially git.  [23:55:28]
<consolers> i have a long list of questions like that  [23:55:33]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: Normal, i will update cvs one week, because i found if you have not udpate long time, will many problem is wrong, you know update
                 of source code is fast.  [23:55:36]
<wfarr> Fair enough.  [23:55:49]
<consolers> each of which make me increasingly mad at the perpetrators of svn  [23:55:51]
<wfarr> I run this every couple of days: http://gist.github.com/30943  [23:55:58]
<consolers> and the millions of dollars spent in marketing it  [23:56:04]
<dsevil> in cvs you have to be on the network to do a diff, right?  [23:56:08]
<consolers> dsevil, cvs design justifies it  [23:56:23]
<dsevil> i *really* like that on svn you don't.  [23:56:39]
<ManateeLazyCat> Oh, i found code that control display of nickname list in ERC, it's "353", i will coding make ERC don't display nickname list when join
                 some channel.  [23:57:14]
<consolers> so by that same principle svn history would be a few kilobytes more
<consolers> sheesh nevermind  [23:57:20]
<wfarr> *cough*http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/*cough*  [23:57:32]
<consolers> collabbet = evil motherfuckers  [23:57:40]
<wfarr> ManateeLazyCat: rcirc has a special omit minor mode that hides the join/part info of anyone who hasn't said something in the channel since you
        joined.  [23:57:59]
<wfarr> It's very handy.  [23:58:03]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: Not that don't display nickname list, just don't display when join. I know rcric have this option, and now i use ERC, ERC have
                 not this option, i will implement it  [23:59:30]

[ë¡˘ 12ë‘¬  6 2008]
<wfarr> Fair enough.  [00:00:23]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: But i switch ERC since i patch to ERC to make it can works with Tabbar  [00:00:26]
<wfarr> Ah.  [00:00:33]
<wfarr> I don't use tabbar, so rcirc works chipper for me.  [00:00:44]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: rcirc is very nice, and ERC is more powerful, in fact, i switch from rcirc to ERC yesterday.  [00:01:29]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: And before i  use rcirc  [00:01:41]
<wfarr> Eh, I don't see how it's "more powerful". Whenever I wanted to make changes, it always seemed the codebase was more convoluted, personally.
                                                                                                                                                [00:02:30]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: Example rcirc can't implement "dcc" command  [00:02:51]
<toddoon> cvs is more complicated than svn, in svn, i do svn list <serveur> and in cvs apparently i have to set a variable CVSROOT  [00:03:19]
<wfarr> ManateeLazyCat: I don't use dcc, but I'm sure it's possible to add it to rcirc.  [00:03:45]
<wfarr> Maybe not via the 'defun-rcirc-command foo, but I mean, it's written in elisp just the same as erc.  [00:04:15]
<wfarr> Technically speaking, it's possible to add pretty much anything in.  [00:04:29]
<ManateeLazyCat> wfarr: In fact, the case that make me switch to rcirc is simple and can works with Tabbar. but now erc can works with Tabbar, so i back
                 to ERC.   [00:05:48]
* wfarr shrugs  [00:06:06]
<e1f> it's completely ironic that ropert pirsig's son was mugged and stabbed to death in front of a zen center in san francisco  [00:11:06]
<e1f> robert  [00:11:10]
<e1f> the only thing more ironic would have been if the bugger rode away on a motorcycle  [00:12:13]
<e1f> mugger  [00:12:20]
